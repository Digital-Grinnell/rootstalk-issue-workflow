In it, I argued that the Western world has a propensity for choosing the wrong heroes, and the wrong kinds of heroes. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-1">Hercules is our archetypical hero. His life, even in infancy, was a playbook of superhuman deeds. He performed astonishing feats—the “twelve labors of Hercules”—showing all the while physical strength, undaunted courage, unimaginable endurance, and the ability to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-1">Yet despite Hercules’s legendary deeds and unequivocal prowess, the thing that strikes me most about him is a deficiency: he is rootless. He lacks a clear and strong connection to any location. He roams, he conquers, never settles down, never has a place that he calls his own, a place that he’s drawn to. As the classicist Emily Butler recently wrote, “[Hercules’s] home is as foreign to him as any place he visits.”</span><span class="CharOverride-11">1</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-1">The West has long admired the Hercules type. To embark on projects in foreign lands, to face seemingly impossible odds, to persevere in the task, ultimately to achieve the goal, win the race, clean up the mess, vanquish the opposition. It’s the stuff of Alexander the Great, Caesar’s conquest of Gaul, Cortez’s overthrow of the Aztecs, Boone’s trailblazing to Kentucky…the list goes on and on.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-1">It’s also the stuff of other kinds of conquests: pioneers “breaking” the prairie in the mid-19th century, Cornelius Vanderbilt forging a railroad empire, Norman Borlaug enabling the “Green Revolution,” Steve Jobs revolutionizing digital content delivery. There is a seductive quality to such conquests, at least to those who tell the stories and those who benefit from them. But ask the Aztecs, or smallholders in India, or the prairie itself, and you might hear a different opinion.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">I</span><span class="CharOverride-1">n my Land Institute essay I called on us to celebrate other kinds of heroes—those who protect rather than conquer, heroes who connect to a place and its people and promote their well-being, heroes like Henry David Thoreau, who so famously connected with the Concord woods, and who also “came to see the violent removal of the Indians from New England as the central tragedy of American history.”</span><span class="CharOverride-11">2</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> Ada Hayden is another of those heroes, who—as early as 1919—called on Iowans to preserve even “a few acres” of prairie in each of the state’s counties, asking plaintively, “why not preserve now at a small cost what can not be replaced at any cost?”</span><span class="CharOverride-11">3</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> Mahatma Gandhi was one of these heroes, too, and on an even larger scale, fighting on behalf of the people and natural environment of India. One could even invoke another ancient hero, Odysseus, whose story “is the ultimate endorsement of </span><span class="CharOverride-2">nostos</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, or homecoming, the idea that a heroic warrior’s greatest triumph comes when he returns from war to his own home and family.”</span><span class="CharOverride-11">4</span><span class="CharOverride-1">  </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">I</span><span class="CharOverride-1">t is in this context that I want to acknowledge Bill Stowe.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-1">Bill was born in Des Moines on January 1, 1959. According to his slightly irreverent obituary published in the Des Moines Register, he was the first baby born in Iowa that year. I doubt that is what made him a leader, but it makes a good story. Bill’s involvement in politics (more on this later) began in high school when he served as a page in the Iowa Senate. He attended Grinnell College and graduated Phi Beta Kappa, then began collecting advanced degrees: a Master of Science in Engineering from the University of Wisconsin, a Master of Science in Industrial Relations from the University of Illinois, and a Juris Doctor from Loyola University Law School. But his credentials are not why Bill is my hero.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">N</span><span class="CharOverride-1">or are his many professional positions, though they are impressively diverse. Bill’s first job was as a field examiner with the National Labor Relations Board, which led to a position as labor relations representative for Inland Steel. After that, for about ten years, he worked in the energy sector—for Shell Oil and MidAmerican Energy—then for two years as the human resources director for the City of Des Moines. In 1999, he changed to being the Assistant Manager of Des Moines’ Public Works/Engineering Department, a position he held for thirteen years before becoming the CEO and General Manager of the Des Moines Water Works (DMWW). It was here that Bill’s heroism and political acumen were revealed to the world. Allow me to set the stage.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">D</span><span class="CharOverride-1">MWW is a regional utility that, its website states, “protects public health and promotes economic development by delivering outstanding quality water, affordably, in reliable quantities, to Des Moines and surrounding communities.” For over 25 years the utility has, in the interest of public health, been removing nitrates from water from the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers, the sources of Des Moines’s drinking water. Excessive nitrate in drinking water is implicated most notably in methemoglobinemia, or “blue baby” syndrome. It may cause other health problems as well.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">T</span><span class="CharOverride-1">he main source of nitrates in drinking water is agricultural runoff. Farmers upriver from Des Moines add nitrogen fertilizer to their fields—mostly in the form of ammonia—to promote leaf growth in their corn and soybeans. Though some ammonia is injected directly into the soil, some is surface applied and is susceptible to washing into drainage ditches and creeks and thence into the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers. You cannot see, smell, or taste nitrates in drinking water. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">D</span><span class="CharOverride-1">MWW operates a denitrification facility to reduce the nitrate level to below a threshold set by the government. This is an expensive process, the cost of which varies from year to year based on fertilizer application rates and rainfall. In 2015, the worst year on record, DMWW had to operate the facility for 177 days at a cost of $1.5 million. That’s just for denitrification. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">R</span><span class="CharOverride-1">eckoning with such costs, Bill Stowe took a bold and controversial step, unanimously backed by the DMWW board of directors. The utility filed a law suit against three upriver county boards of supervisors for failing to control the nitrate level of water in the rivers in violation of the Clean Water Act. Stowe argued that the counties (which own and operate agricultural drainage pipes) had not been doing what they should have been doing, namely monitoring nitrate runoff as point-source pollution with an aim to regulating it. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">T</span><span class="CharOverride-1">he lawsuit received extensive media coverage in Iowa and beyond, and for good reason. Opposition to the lawsuit was fierce and immediate. It came from many extremely powerful and well-financed agricultural interests in Iowa and beyond. The state legislature began exploring ways to derail the lawsuit. The governor accused DMWW of exacerbating the urban-rural divide. Stowe was personally attacked and vilified. In the end, the courts dismissed the suit. Had DMWW prevailed, it could have reshaped the face of Midwestern agriculture. (For a fuller account, see Chapter 13 of Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Art Cullen’s recent book, </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Storm Lake: A Chronicle of Change, Resilience, and Hope from a Heartland Newspaper</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, Viking 2018).</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">S</span><span class="CharOverride-1">o, Bill Stowe is my hero because he cared about Iowa’s water and about Iowans themselves enough to fight for their health. He took a stand that involved no personal gain but exacted a high cost in terms of relationships and mental distress. He faced a withering backlash with patience and poise.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">A</span><span class="CharOverride-1">bout a year after the lawsuit was dismissed, Bill was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that took his life earlier this year at the age of 60. Hugh Espey, Executive Director of Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, writing a remembrance of Bill on his organization’s website, remarked, “Bill often said in the fight for clean water, ‘lean forward.’” May Bill’s example lead us all to do the same.</span></p>

			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-25">Rootstalk:</span><span class="CharOverride-26"> </span>I read the court ruling on Des Moines Water Works versus the counties [DWWW brought suit against three agricultural counties upstream from Des Moines, in which the agency held that the counties should be considered to be point-source polluters, and should pay damages for the negative effects their practices had on Iowans living downstream]. I was wondering what you thought of the ruling, and if you were to respond to it, what you would say.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"> </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-19">Stowe: </span>You know, there are actually two rulings. I assume you read the Iowa State Supreme Court decision and then there was also a decision from a U.S. District Court here in Iowa. In both cases, we were certainly disappointed. In the Iowa case, the Iowa Supreme Court by a 3 to 2 majority, basically said that we did not have standing to...sue [the] drainage districts in Iowa. [These are the] public utilities that drain farmland. [They are] supervised by a county board of supervisors [and are held to be] immune from suits, particularly [those brought by] other public entities [such as] the Des Moines Water Works. So, [we were] certainly disappointed by that [decision]. But I understand and respect the rule of law and the court’s ultimate jurisdiction.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"> &#9;&#9;The other ruling was from a Federal Court, and we had serious disagreement with [the ruling because it] essentially just sidestepped the whole idea about whether agriculture is immune from suit for violations of environmental laws. And that is a far more serious issue for us than this kind of nuanced issue about whether a local government can sue another local government within the Iowa Constitution. So, we accepted the Iowa Supreme Court decision, we were disappointed by it, certainly, but the federal decision that essentially said it wasn’t even going to rule on the basic issue of whether agriculture should be regulated under the Clean Water Act was a huge disappointment for us.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-25">Rootstalk:</span><span class="CharOverride-26"> </span>Why do you think they ruled that way?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"> </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-19">Stowe: </span>Well, I mean, clearly the judge thought he was following federal law. We think it’s an error of law and certainly regret that. But you know the motives of judges and the motives of all of us are always arguable, and [it’s] pretty speculative for us to put ourselves in their position and guess why it is they did it. I have every reason to believe that the federal judge believed he was following federal law, but it just reinforces the myth that agriculture is unregulated under the Clean Water Act. And that’s a huge concern for us and should be for all Americans. Yeah, I mean what kind of precedent-keeping is that law? I think it’s pretty narrow, because this is out of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Iowa. So relatively narrow.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"> &#9;&#9;District court rulings generally aren’t authoritative in driving decisions of other district courts, but it certainly makes an argument that our enemies will carry forward into other venues even though I don’t think it decides the case. It certainly gives them a bit of an upper hand that we would certainly not intend to give them.</p>

Now that agriculture has seemingly been given a free license in the wild, wild West to do whatever they want in terms of environmental damage to our surface waters, we’re compensating for that by spending a significant amount of money<span class="Author-Name CharOverride-5">—</span>tens of millions of dollars<span class="Author-Name CharOverride-5"> </span>over the next five to 10 years<span class="Author-Name CharOverride-5">—</span>to deal with the fact that polluters don’t have accountability here, and [will] continue—in their narrow self-interest—to push pollutants to us downstream.

But at the end of the day, there’s no question that our ratepayers are subsidizing upstream producers who are polluters that are polluting our surface waters. And that’s a real problem. There is an extra analogy there. The industrial agricultural model of row crops (corn and soybeans) and livestock (particularly hogs) in Iowa and their current method of farming particularly in our waterways is exporting all kinds of pollutants into the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers. And our rate-payers are paying to clean it up just to make it safe for them to drink.</p>

Or if I am, I’ve done a pretty poor job so far in my life. at prophesizing what’s going to happen. I think there will be a shift over time because ultimately this model of industrial agriculture actually lessens and exhausts the resource of the land that the farmers themselves own.</p>

			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-25">Rootstalk:</span><span class="CharOverride-26"> </span>That’s very scary. But it also seems like, at least in name, the state is trying to address it with the Nutrient Reduction Srategy?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"> </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-19">Stowe:</span> I’m a native Iowan. I’m 60 years old. I’ve been around the state for most of those 60 years. And the idea of conservation practices adopted by some farmers and not by others has been really the only [established environmental protection policy concerning] the surface waters of the state. So, the Nutrient Reduction Strategy essentially codified what’s the status quo in a very ineffective process with stakeholders who have every interest in maintaining the status quo and maintaining a voluntary strategy which really does nothing, other than continue to encourage producers to produce more and pollute more.</p>

As an example, in pesticide drift there are other aspects of the industrial agricultural model that go beyond drinking water. But I think you get the point that a model of tilling more land, adding more chemicals, producing higher yields in the short-term, continues to lead towards long-term consequences. The short-term effects [include] things like the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico and the type of water quality that we’re experiencing here in Iowa. Who wants to go swimming or boating in our rivers? We would far prefer, as Iowans, to go to Minnesota, Wisconsin, where we know the waters are better protected and in better shape than we would here. The Nutrient Reduction Strategy plays into that do-nothing, whistle-in-the-dark kind of mentality.</p>

			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-19">Stowe:</span> Well ultimately, we hope cooler regulatory heads will prevail. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency right now is a complete debacle [in the way it’s] rolling back environmental protections. But the timeframe for that obviously is a concern for us because many of the issues that we face are short-term public health consequences. Seventy-five percent or so of Des Moines Public School students receive subsidized school lunches. They and their parents, their families, are paying higher water rates because polluters upstream who affect the drinking water downstream are unaccountable. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"> <span class="CharOverride-25">Rootstalk:</span><span class="CharOverride-26"> </span>I think a lot of people might say, “It’s very difficult to farm, and if you’re trying to feed as many people as possible and keep the farm afloat...you need to use chemicals.” How do you respond to that?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"> </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-19">Stowe: </span>Well, there are a couple of things going on in the question. One of them is that “farming is difficult.” That may well be, but it’s a business, and you know we’re not talking about some kind of Norman Rockwell picture here or American Gothic. Farming in this state is a multimillion-dollar business. This is industrial agriculture, with industrial chemicals, and industrial hybrid seeds, and industrial machinery, [all used on a] large scale. So, [let’s] break that myth a little bit. More production of hogs and field corn and soybeans isn’t necessarily feeding the world. If you go to a local market, 90 percent or so of the food that you’re buying is not from Iowa. We have just become the sacrifice state—the pollutants sinkhole, if you will—in which these industrial models that generate lots of waste and lots of agro toxins are allowed to continue unfettered.</p>

			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-25">Rootstalk:</span><span class="CharOverride-26"> </span>Wow, that’s tough language to use, calling Iowa [an environmental] sinkhole. Can you can go into that more?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"> </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-19">Stowe:</span> Sure, happy to. If you were to look longitudinally at the water quality in this state, you’re going to see alarming trends of more and more pollutants coming into our waters. There are many people within the public health community that see manifestations of that which are very disconcerting. In Iowa, private wells aren’t tested, but [there’s] a lot of concern that there are consequences [affecting our] drinking water. [This is] an essential part of our day-to-day living [which has significant] social and economic implications, particularly for those with lesser incomes. And, again, to [call the] current farming model at work on Iowa’s family farms “subsistence farming” is really [to perpetuate] a myth.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7">&#9;&#9;We need to think as a community and think of the implications of the continued emphasis on higher yields and short-term profits in industrial agriculture. [We need to turn] away from that, and start thinking more about the community aspects for our neighbors, for our communities, for downstream water users, and—ultimately—for the soil that we all depend on in this state for our economic prosperity.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs ParaOverride-7">&#9;&#9;The bottom line is this: drinking water is going to become unaffordable or else available but dangerous for people to drink. And that is a significant concern for those of us who are in this business. We’re not selling a typical commodity, we’re in the public health business. I’m not selling Grinnell Pioneer sweatshirts or beer. I’m in the process of working, with many others, to sell drinking water, which you can’t live without.</p>

As a small child I was blessed with the freedom that comes from growing up in a rural community. I could play outside whenever I wanted, which was all of the time. I swam in </span><a href="https://www.parkrec.nd.gov/lake-sakakawea-state-park"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Lake Sakakawea</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> (a reservoir of the Missouri River) from sunup to sundown in the summers at my grandparents’ house. I climbed hills and explored the badlands. We had no video games or cell phones, so adults always told us to go outside and play. We often went with our grandma to pick chokecherries and made the most delicious chokecherry jams and syrups I’ve ever had. We canned them for the winter months and made other things, too, like the homemade apple turnovers that I loved so much! </span></p>

We went fishing on the lake from his pontoon boat, traveling from Mossett Bay (aka Charging Eagle Bay) over to McKenzie Bay for ice cream in the summer. We went ice fishing on the lake in the winter. It was all so perfect and idyllic for me.</span></p>

I didn’t know North Dakota was and still is home to the nation’s only commercial-scale coal gasification plant, which can strip paint off cars parked in the wrong area under certain conditions. I didn’t realize all of this activity was polluting the lake that I loved so much and swam in every day.

This is an extremely rapidly spreading cancer that’s usually attached to muscle or bone. What made it rare in my case was that it wasn’t attached to my muscle or bone; it was right there in the subcutaneous tissue of the left side of my stomach, where I could see it and feel it and watch it spreading. I remember the morning I woke up and noticed that the pea-sized lump I discovered on my tummy just a few days before had grown and was now changing color. Because of the fact that so many people on the reservation had already dealt with cancer in the past, I knew that this was not good and that I had to get to the doctor. </span></p>

I remember feeling scared because I was pretty certain that it was cancer, and I remember feeling completely taken aback when the doctor asked if I had somehow just bumped into a high-backed chair and bruised myself. He told me it looked like a bruise, and he thought I just had calcium build up from an old scar that was there. As a result, he would not give me a referral to see a specialist. Without the referral, there was nothing I could do because I had no other form of healthcare and no money. My doctor told me to come back in 30 days and sent me home. </span></p>

The doctor took one look, signed my referral papers, and I was on my way to Altru clinic in Grand Forks, ND to have tumor removal surgery. The tumor had to be sent to Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and my family and I waited over two weeks before we found out for sure that it was malignant. In total I had 5 surgeries to deal with my cancer, and in the end, I refused localized chemotherapy or radiation because I had heard the horror stories of women whose good cells were so damaged by the chemo that they could not safely have children. </span></p>

I became aware of just how high the cancer rates were in North Dakota, and I wanted to learn more. As I began my research on cancer, I began noticing clear patterns of health issues in low-income, minority and low-population communities. There was no question that these communities had disproportionate rates of cancers, asthmas, diabetes, heart attacks and miscarriages. There was also no question that most of these communities were near major pollution sources, including coal-fired power plants, coal, oil, gas and uranium extraction sites, and nuclear power plant sites. </span></p>

The committee has gone through many name changes over the years, but the work has remained the same: protecting our people and communities from harms caused by fossil fuel. We started out fighting against the installation of a tar sands oil refinery on our reservation. We’ve continued fighting against the proposed refinery ever since and have thus-far succeeded at stopping it. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">A</span><span class="CharOverride-1">fter my brush with cancer, I felt fortunate that I could finish my undergraduate degree in Natural Resource and Park Management in 2001. I went on to work in state and national parks, including </span><a href="https://www.nps.gov/bibe/index.htm"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Big Bend National Park</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> in Texas and </span><a href="https://www.parkrec.nd.gov/fort-abraham-lincoln-state-park"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> in North Dakota. During this time, I came to understand that our country sets aside pieces of land for resource management and destroys the rest for development or extraction. I didn’t know exactly what to do with this realization, so I returned to the University of North Dakota to work on my Masters Degree in Environmental Management and successfully completed the Earth Systems Science and Policy Program in December of 2006. It was then that I learned about the Indigenous Environmental Network and decided I wanted to join them. I applied and was fortunate enough to be chosen out of 14 candidates to become the newest member of the IEN team in February of 2007.</span></p>

While our Tribal Council, made up of all men, made decisions for us that were not in the best interest of the environment, future generations, or any of us alive today breathing the air and drinking the water, we women stepped up again and began taking matters into our own hands. We decided to dig a little deeper and found out that toxins, many of them carcinogenic, were put into our water and into our air as a result of the fracking, so we looked for the regulations and found a lack thereof. We decided that being poisoned—with or without our knowledge or free, prior and informed consent—was not acceptable here or anywhere, and we pushed back against the fracking industry. We remain embroiled in that battle even today, with some of us fighting for regulations and others of us fighting to ban fracking altogether.</span></p>

It means communities are actively seeking to improve and change the current system of fossil fuel destruction and abuse. You see, women have a deep and abiding tie to the land, called blood memory. It’s this blood memory that ties all women to our Mother Earth and gives us the instinct to care for our families and communities just as our Mother Earth cares for and provides for all living beings through clean water to drink, clean air to breath and clean soil in which to grow our food, none of which we can survive or thrive without.  </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">I</span><span class="CharOverride-1">t’s because of this blood memory that we can’t stand our earth being ripped apart, blown up, dug up and desecrated by the extraction of fossil fuels. It has often been said that the rape of Mother Earth is the rape of women, and this is where I return to my story’s frame: violence perpetrated against the earth through fossil fuel extraction leads to violence perpetrated against women. When fracking came to our little communities in rural North Dakota, we fully understood what that meant, as the violence against women in our communities increased exponentially. Although data is lacking on the reservation itself, counties in North Dakota near oil extraction sites saw an 18.5 percent increase in violent crime between 2006 and 2012. As man-camps ruled the prairies, women and children became the victims of men working grueling hours in the oil fields with little to do in their down time besides haunt the small town bars and engage in predatory behavior—against women particularly, but also against children and men. Fort Berthold became ground zero for sex trafficking, and the numbers continue to go egregiously underreported throughout the state.</span></p>

In 2016, North Dakota was the second largest crude oil producing state due to fracking. In 2017, two-thirds of North Dakota’s net electricity generation still came from coal, which is ironic considering that North Dakota has abundant wind resources, ranking ninth in the nation for utility-scale generation. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">I </span><span class="CharOverride-1">also found out through the </span><a href="https://www.ndhealth.gov"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">North Dakota Department of Health</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> that all of North Dakota’s rivers, lakes and streams—over 11,000 miles of them—are contaminated with mercury due to years of coal extraction. Women in particular are told not to consume too much fish during pregnancy, because of the dangers posed by mercury exposure to the unborn child. These dangers do not even take into account the exposures we face as a result of the oil drilling and the subsequent flaring of natural gas in the Bakken. More and more fish are pulled out of Lake Sakakawea with deformities. Blue green algae blooms, which used to cause fish die-offs only rarely, are now becoming the norm. However, they continue to go underreported and get covered up. Growing up, I loved eating walleye taken fresh from the lake, battered and fried up right there near the shores. I wonder now if that and other facets of my day-to-day life in North Dakota led to my recent heartbreaking miscarriage, or to my sisters’ miscarriages, or to all of my cousins’ miscarriages. We just live with the fact that we may never truly know or be able to prove a connection. </span></p>

We have seen that it’s difficult and sometimes dangerous work to fight back against the greed of the multi-billion-dollar fossil fuel industry to protect our families and our water. We see that we need to educate people on a different and better way to live upon the earth. Even though there’s backlash due to corporate and industrial propaganda, the work we do is necessary, and it must not end until justice has been realized for everyone, including those of us that have dealt with environmental injustice our whole lives. </span></p>

If the existing plant community is acceptable, but you wish to improve the diversity of plants and add specific flowering plants such as milkweed for monarch butterflies or fall asters to provide late-season forage for honeybees, then “frost interseeding” can work. Broadcast seed in very late fall before snow, during the winter if the ground is not snow covered, or in the very early spring when just a small amount of snow is on the ground and melting quickly. This should be done on ground that was burned or mowed short in the fall, or raked in areas to expose soil so those seeds can touch moist soil.</span></p>

It is more ecologically beneficial and helps you achieve more success with your planting when you use a great diversity of seed. Depending on the seasons, each year different plants will flower, and the diversity will give you a better chance of having a strong stand of preferred plant communities. Native seed is expensive, so planning for success is important.</span></p>

One method for controlling thistle that I have found effective in fields (not untilled pastures), is to plant sorghum sudan grass in the spring into tilled soil and continually mow it, up to three or four times in the season when it gets to about two feet tall. You don’t want the sudan to get too tall, or else it will smother itself when you mow it. You can harvest it for forage, or just leave it in the field, depending on how much thistle there is. Using this method, the thistle grows with the sudan, and fights for light in the thick and fast-growing stand. Each time you mow, the thistle has to start all over again, and since it is somewhat smothered by the sudan, it is using up and weakening its roots rather than gaining nutrients from the soil or sun. By cutting it numerous times, you continually weaken the root. After one season, I have seen a 75 percent drop in the thistle present; after two years of doing this, we were able to get rid of just about all of the thistle. You could also just mow each time the thistle starts to flower the first year and do the sudan grass treatment the second year, to save you two years of tillage. If you only have a few thistles, you can dig up the roots. Continual tillage only cuts up the roots and makes more plants, not less.</span></p>
			<p><span class="CharOverride-33">Using tillage</span> </p>

Then field cultivate, disc or use whatever tillage you want to prepare a seed bed and plant winter rye. This is between mid-August and mid-September for southern Wisconsin; you should adjust this timing for your region. Field cultivating works especially well for controlling quack grass, if you remember to let those quack grass roots dry out in the sun. The following spring, till in the rye when it is less than a foot tall. This will be sometime in May—earlier if an early spring, later if a late spring. Then plant a thick stand of oats. Let this grow until late June and then till it in. Drill soybeans in early to mid-July—yes, I said soybeans. Drill them thick and they will come up very quickly in the warm soil (hopefully, you will have enough moisture), and will canopy over the tight rows. We had very little growth of grasses or broadleaves under our soybeans. We have done this numerous times for fall vegetable production and have had success in controlling weeds with the use of July-planted soybeans. If we are following with vegetables, we would mow off the beans and till in August. For the native prairie, we let the soybeans go until the end of September and mowed them then. The thick canopy provided excellent weed control for us and left us with a firm seed bed, mostly free of weeds. We did not do any further tillage after the soybeans before we planted the prairie. We then planted our prairie seed using a broadcast seeder and went over the field with a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultipacker"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">cultipacker</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> in late October. It snowed the following week—perfect timing. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">T</span><span class="CharOverride-1">he first year, we mowed twice, when the plants were about 14-18 inches tall. The second year, we hand-pulled some problem weeds in our one acre. </span><span class="CharOverride-34">We did a prescribed burn, with a good firebreak around the acre, and good planning to prevent the fire from going beyond borders. </span><span class="CharOverride-1">A rule of thumb is that spring burns favor native grasses and fall burns favor native flowering plants, or forbs. Since we are managing our prairie for our own honeybees, native pollinators and butterflies, we favor the flowering forbs. Our prairie has a diverse stand of native grasses, too, which hold soil and are very beautiful as well.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">P</span><span class="CharOverride-1">rofessionals typically recommend the use of herbicides to achieve the weed-free, firm seedbed that is required to plant your native seeds. Any method that lessens the weed seed bank, lessens the number of weeds growing in the top inch or two of soil, and does not disturb the soil to bring up new weed seeds, could be used to successfully plant native grassland species. Experiment with various techniques on small areas to familiarize yourself with the timing of seeding and mowing for your soil type and climate, and then move to larger acreages. You will be rewarded for your work and stewardship with the environmental stability a permanent sod cover provides: diverse wildlife habitat and the blissful beauty of a prairie with different blooming plants throughout the growing season.</span></p>

I told her I wanted to be part of that energy and optimism. I’m sure a Polaris space shuttle would not have looked like a regular one, but dammit, they’d figure it out and do it. My old boss at BMW (and at Fiat SpA, where I’d worked before that) had said that, in the future, “Fiat would be mining rocks on the moon when BMW was in a museum.” In Polaris, I saw an example of a forward thinking company like Fiat, right in front of me.</span></p>

As I joined them, there would be a brief exchange about where we were going, and then everyone would roar off at full-speed. Most of the time, I was told, leaving the plant meant riding alongside the highway in one direction or another, in the ditch.

Our group includes Digital Design, responsible for the UI/UX (user interface/user experience) of our gauges, Infotainment, App and Web. With fewer than half the designers working for our next biggest competitor, our department is twice as fast, helping Polaris be segment leaders in many markets due to our ability to innovate within our competitors’ development timeframes—often making a second or third-generation machine when others have just entered the market.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">S</span><span class="CharOverride-2">ince the middle of the 19th century, farm families in the Midwest have aspired to improve their situation through education. Our current school system, and frankly our society as a whole, is based on the premise that if you work hard enough you can achieve what you set your mind to. This belief may provide people with hope—it suggests individuals control their destiny—but embedded in the rhetoric is the subtext that failure to succeed must mean personal inadequacy. This message obscures the effects that socioeconomic factors can have on a person’s success despite that person’s hard work or ability. Socioeconomic effects are hard to measure because they vary with geographic location. In her 2001 book </span><span class="CharOverride-1">Literacy in American Lives</span><span class="CharOverride-2">, professor Deborah Brandt demonstrates some of the general dynamics of the relationship between opportunity, reward for literacy, and economies through a case study of two Midwestern farm women.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1"> </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"> <span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> Can you tell me about the origins of <span class="CharOverride-27">Literacy in American Lives</span>? How did you get interested in the topic which you write about in the book?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>For nearly 30 years I taught writing and courses about writing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I was always interested in the social conditions for literacy learning, particularly the ways in which the rising standards for literacy achievement affect everyday people and their families. By “rising standards” I mean the need for more and more people to do more and more things with literacy, an escalating demand that was so much of the story in 20th century America and continues into the 21st century. How do people cope with these unrelenting demands? </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;The only way I could think to find answers to these questions was to go out and talk with people. So, in the early 1990s, I did in-depth interviews with 100 people from all walks of life, born between 1895 and 1985, asking them to remember everything they could about how they learned to read and write, in and out of school, from their very earliest memories to the present. Many of the interviewees grew up in the Midwest, but others migrated from other regions in the U.S. and other countries. They were all living at the time of the interviews in Dane County, Wisconsin, where I lived and taught. So <span class="CharOverride-27">Literacy in American Lives</span> is an analysis and interpretation of those astonishingly rich and detailed—and often surprising—interviews.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> Is literacy more than simply the ability to read?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>Literacy certainly can be seen as the ability to read and, I would add, to write. But there is nothing simple about it. First, you have to ask: the ability to read or write what? In what capacity? For what end? So, for instance, I might be able to read a recipe and follow the words but end up making a disaster of a meal. A master chef might read the same recipe and create something much better than even the recipe called for. The chef and I will see the same words, but they will mean different things to us. We will operate them differently. And all reading and writing works like that—the ability to read and write is not stable. It depends on context. It is always relational. And what counts as literacy or enough literacy is always changing. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> What affects people’s ability to attain literacy?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>I would say anything and everything affects our ability to attain literacy—where we live, when we live, who we live with, how we are treated, how literacy is treated, what is expected of us, what learning opportunities are presented to us, how we respond to them, how things change or do not change around us. Literacy is knitted into the social and economic and political contexts in which we live, and it will be acquired (or will need to be reacquired) as both a reflection and a product of those contexts. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> Why did you decide to begin your study by portraying the lives of two Midwestern farm women, Martha Day, born in 1903, and Barbara Hunt, born in 1971? </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>During the interviewing phase of the project, I was just trying to find volunteers who were willing to spend a couple of hours talking with me about their memories of reading and writing. So among other places, I went to local elder care facilities and to various schools, including the local community college. Martha Day, born 1903, lived in an assisted living facility and volunteered for the project. Barbara Hunt, born 1971, was attending the community college and volunteered for the project. As a coincidence, they both grew up on small, family owned dairy farms in the Midwest, one at the beginning and one close to the end of the twentieth century. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> The two women were born 68 years apart. However, you found that there were some similarities in their backgrounds. What were they?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>I tried to make the point that these two women had some striking similarities in their backgrounds but that the meaning of those similarities really changed between the early 20th century and the late 20th century. Both were raised on 80-acre, low-income dairy farms that their fathers had inherited, Martha Day in northern Indiana and Barbara Hunt in southern Wisconsin. Both grew up in sparse, rural settlements of about 500 people, quite a distance from stores and schools. Neither had money nor family encouragement for schooling beyond the 12th grade, and both left home and went to work shortly after high school graduation. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> Despite their common background, how did the effect of the farm economy on their literacy experiences differ?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>In the 1920s many children of farmers, including Martha Day, were moving to bigger cities because of employment opportunities. Interestingly, it was because of the general health of the agrarian economy at the beginning of the twentieth century that more farm families had surplus money to buy commercial goods, like appliances, magazines, and clothing. Banks also thrived in service to farmers. So service jobs could be found in the larger cities. As people migrated, though, they brought their hometown, homogeneous, close-knit social networks with them. “I never did have to hunt for jobs then,” Martha Day recalled. “Somebody from my area would just call up and say, we have a job, would you be interested?” Martha Day carried her religious affiliations with her, too, and started attending a Sunday School class for young adults, volunteering to write a newsletter for the group. Her interest in writing attracted the attention of her Sunday School teacher, who happened to be the editor of a regional farm magazine. He set her up with a typewriter and desk in her home and taught her how to write journalism. “He would say, ‘Imagine you are a farm woman.’ That I grew up on a farm helped me in some respects. It wouldn’t today,” she told me. Her social network launched her eventually into editorial positions in corporate offices as farm magazines were bought up and merged by media conglomerates. By the time she retired in 1968, the heyday of farm magazines was over. But for a time, as we can see, the social structure of the agrarian village still operated in Martha Day’s favor even as she made the transition into an urban economy. Her identity as a farm woman was exploitable by her sponsor (the farm journal), and she traded on that identity for a chance to write for a living. That give and take is a key feature of the literacy sponsor-literacy sponsored relationship.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;By the time of Barbara Hunt’s birth in 1971, there had been 50 more years of shrinkage in the family farm economy, bringing disintegration of the societies that supported it. Barbara Hunt’s hometown was struggling—isolated, poor, and weakly tied to the region around it, which had become a cosmopolitan, school-oriented, tech-heavy, knowledge-making service economy. The work she could find was not tied to agriculture. Initially hired as a home health aide, she was laid off when medical providers consolidated, and her agency moved out of the area. Instead, she went to work at the cash register of an Exxon gas station and did babysitting on the side while pursuing her studies part-time at the community college. Interestingly, the remnants of the long, rich agrarian cultural tradition still could be found, if attenuated, supporting Barbara Hunt’s literacy development. In eighth grade, she joined the forensics club in her school (“As soon as I heard about it, I knew I wanted to be in it,” she said.) Her forensics club was part of a statewide consortium of speech, debate, and theatre clubs that had been founded in 1895 by a school superintendent from the same district in which Hunt was a student. (In fact, it had been the first high-school forensics association established in the United States.) As a participant in competitions, Hunt wrote speeches on topics of her choice, involving issues that “didn’t affect me directly, but did affect other people,” including the problem of homelessness. The forensics club provided opportunities for Barbara Hunt to conduct research, express, write, and argue, an experience that helped her find resonance with an urban-oriented social service degree program in her community college. At the time we talked, she was training to be a technical assistant with interests in services for the displaced. So Barbara Hunt, to me, represents many of the young people of the late 20th and early 21st century who must pursue literacy in contexts of fragmentation, volatility, anonymity, and escalating demands for credentialed education.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> You write about “sponsors of literacy.” What does that mean, and why is it important? </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>Our literacy, as we know, has tremendous value in our lives and motivates our efforts to acquire it. It enables individual growth, learning, connection, knowledge, and social and economic security. Literacy is good in our lives and, often, the more, the better. But our literacy also has tremendous value for other people or interests who need our literacy to pursue their own ends. In the wider arena, the literacy of the people is considered a good, a raw material, a resource, a necessary ingredient in the making of products and services and profits. Our literacy helps those who use our literacy to make money or achieve power or spread their values. Those entities—the ones who need our literacy as much or more than we do—are sponsors of literacy. Think employers, governments, religions, social movements. Think Facebook. These entities will teach, encourage, support and stimulate literacy in various ways, but they do so in order to realize their own goals, which do not always necessarily converge with our goals. Sponsors of literacy will compete with each other for our skills and for our loyalty to their version of literacy. They also can gain advantage by destabilizing existing forms of literacy by, say, introducing new communication technologies or other changes. Then we have to hustle to respond to those changes. Sponsors enable literacy learning (we need them), but they introduce inequity and volatility into our efforts to pursue literacy or secure it for our children.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> In your book you mention that the need for more and more people to do more things with their literacy also has an effect on individual literacies. What is that effect?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>In the not so distant past most people worked with their muscles. Today, most people work with their minds. We have been transformed from a farming and manufacturing economy into a service economy or what some call a knowledge or information economy. In this transition, literacy became a dominant form of labor. Today, just about everyone writes on their jobs now, and it is not uncommon for people to spend three, four, five, eight or more hours a day in the posture of the writer—communicating, recording, analyzing, interpreting, and responding to others who are also writing. In many industries, written products are the only products. We are living at a time of tremendous pressure on our literacy skills as they are pulled more and more deeply into the engines of production and profit in our economy. This puts pressure on young people, as well, to achieve forms of advanced education and to adapt to rapid changes in the forms and levels of literate communication. The U.S. must compete with other nations in innovation, efficiency, speed, and productivity. These competitions are waged with the literacy of the population. So we can expect the “literacy crisis” to be a perpetual problem, not because people are not learning the way they used to but because so much more is being demanded and the repercussions for not keeping up are more punishing.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk: </span>Do you believe that Hunt or Day were aware of the impact the economy and sponsors of literacy had on their lives, or did they explain their lives in terms of their own strengths or weaknesses?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>Perhaps because of the influence of school, we are invited to think of literacy as an individual skill. Do I make the grade? Why is my child having trouble learning to read? That young generation just can’t spell! We have all experienced or heard things like this. So Martha Day, Barbara Hunt, and I, for that matter, are not immune to those messages. But to your question I have to answer that Martha Day and Barbara Hunt were aware of the impact of the economy and sponsors of literacy in their lives, or else I would not have found evidence of these impacts when I analyzed their testimonies and the testimonies of all the other people I interviewed. All I asked people to do was to try to remember the scenes of their literacy learning across time. I was just about flabbergasted at the number and variety of figures who turned up at these scenes as they were recalled: older relatives, teachers, religious leaders, supervisors, military officers. These many references could not be ignored. As I worked with them, I came to understand them as sponsors of literacy, to see how those sponsors proliferated across the generations, and to appreciate how they linked individual literacy efforts to larger material and historical systems. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"> </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk: </span>Do you think it’s particularly important for individuals in declining economies, like the farm economy, to learn about literacy in the context of socioeconomic factors?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>As I mentioned, our society tends to hold simplistic notions of literacy; we are invited to think of reading and writing as neutral, timeless, and portable skills. So I think everyone can benefit from understanding that literacy is contextual and relational. When it comes to literacy learning, it is potentially advantageous to belong to a dominant economy, whether in periods of stability or change. We saw those advantages operating in the life of Martha Day. But for the young Barbara Hunt, those advantages were not available. If it took the society as a whole three or four generations to make the transition from agriculture to post-industrialism, Barbara Hunt, and millions of other young Americans from forgotten economies, have to make that transition in one fell swoop, in the span of their youth. This is where literacy disadvantage and economic disadvantage find their relationship. It is not fair, but for society to ignore that unfairness is a double injustice. So, to answer your question, wherever we are positioned—whether students, teachers, policymakers, concerned citizens, elected representatives or business leaders—it is important to learn about literacy in the context of socioeconomic factors. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> It seems external factors like the economy strongly influence the way people become literate. Can becoming literate be more equitable or at least be less entangled with the economy?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>This is where the role of public education becomes so critical. Democratic institutions, including the public schools, exist partly to rebalance injustice—to make sure that any differences in health, inheritance, origin of birth, or other inequalities do not over-determine one’s life chances. Democratic institutions are supposed to serve this function by expanding the control that individuals have over the decisions that affect their lives and by making sure that our collective resources and civil rights are equally accessible by all members. Literacy is central to equality because it is central to our participation in the political process: our right to know, our right to petition, our right to be understood. Inequalities in access and reward for literacy are symptoms of a more general disenfranchisement and aggravate it. So, it is important to remember what schooling is really for, especially when economic interests have such a huge influence over educational policy and practice. Inclusion and equality need to be not only the means of education but also the outcome. From all angles—policy to pedagogy—literacy needs to be addressed in a civil rights context. Understanding and not simply accommodating economic and technological change is a vital responsibility of a democratic school. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> Does individual initiative or intelligence still have a role to play in people’s literacy? </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Brandt: </span>It is important to say that I am not trying to make the case that our literacy is determined by the contexts in which we live in any predictable or monolithic way. Martha Day’s experience a century back was not the only—or even the most typical—experience of the farm people of her generation. Among other Midwestern European Americans of her cohort that I interviewed, extreme physical isolation, poor schooling, instability in farm prices and the catastrophes of the Depression all made access to material and institutional supports for literacy difficult and sometimes impossible. For people bearing the burden of racial discrimination, the conditions were usually more difficult. But as Martha Day’s individual initiative and intelligence played a role in her literacy outcomes, they came from a mentality that others shared around her. Success and failure, especially in literacy, are always co-creations. Our economic condition will not determine our literacy. But it will matter in ways that we can analyze.</p>

They would spend whole days swimming out in the lake, waging squirt gun wars against each other, and walking downtown to buy Little Debbie snacks. However, this time of childhood bliss was interrupted one day when a girl quietly pulled Boyce aside and conspiratorially whispered, “Hey, do you realize we are the only normal people here?”</span></p>

He aspires to create a supportive community where people genuinely understand that developmental disabilities bring different kinds of value as well as various new perspectives in looking at our world. What would it take, he asks, to build a world where kids and families sought out and actively relished disability as a rich form of human difference that they can learn and gain from, like any other form of diversity? </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">“</span><span class="CharOverride-1">True inclusion takes changing mindsets,” Boyce argues. He believes that most of our thinking is still firmly rooted in old ways of conceiving of disabilities. If we think of disabilities just as a deficit or something to be pitied, we will only see a small part of the bigger picture. He created Cow Tipping Press, a non-profit organization currently located in Minneapolis, to provide opportunities to relish assets rather than pity deficits through the unique lens of creative writing. By teaching inclusive writing classes for adults with developmental disabilities, Boyce believes they gain the “radical chance to speak for themselves in a medium usually used to speak about them.”</span></p>

I always read some books and sometimes all I was doing for the day was reading some mystery books and sometimes even some poetry books. So after a while since I was reading them so much I grew up with a skill—as I like to call it, the great power in words. I can write poems that catch people’s attention and some short stories that can make people smile. Now I’m even trying to make some books of my own and sell them at maybe an art fair. Heck, one of the biggest surprises is how I found how good I am at it. Another surprise is what words do to me. I could be in the angriest mood whatsoever, and by either reading or brainstorming, a poem can calm me down. Well that’s just the beginning.”</span></p>

They have a lot to say. “After two years of running Cow Tipping Press, I can still enter a Day-training and Habilitation (DTH) facility, group home, or special ed classroom and marvel at the creativity, diversity, quirks, frustrations, and ingenuity of the one in 50 peers with developmental disabilities we all were born alongside. That so few of us know and see these traits on a daily basis is a choice we have made about how to set up our society: its mindsets, structures, policies, funding. I hope these pieces beg the question: what other assets are we leaving on the table when we don’t choose to change it?”</span></p>

Her mother died within a few hours of the baby’s birth, so Cornelia was “baptized over the coffin with her mother’s name,” as her mother’s obituary had it. At the time, her father was farming north of Grinnell, Iowa, and, except for her father’s mother, who came to Iowa to keep house and care for the baby, Cornelia lived a fairly lonely childhood, occupying herself with the animals and plants she found around the farmstead. These early experiences with the natural world proved crucial to her life-long interest in nature and her ability to photograph it.</span></p>

Cornelia carried on, and continued to publish her photographs, but soon after her father’s death she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which killed her September 29, 1936. She bequeathed some 3300 glass plate negatives to Henry Conard, who abandoned them at the University of Iowa when he retired in the 1950s. Fifty years later 1100 of her botanical images were discovered in poor condition, but saved by the State Historical Society of Iowa. The fate of the other 2200 negatives—of insects and animals, including cats—is unknown.</span></p>

Like other lilies they fasten to the stem with narrow parts of the petals and sepals, then abruptly widen and grow more colorful. Near the place of widening they are spotted with small purple spots. The blossoms do not open as widely as those of the Wood Lily but instead the petals and sepals stay more upright. The stamens and three-part pistils are pink tipped with brown which adds much to their beauty. </span></p>

I’d been told nothing was there any longer, but I still felt a deep need to visit the place. The eight-year education I had received there was by far the most important and relevant of my life, much more so than high school, college, and beyond. Now, however, the land was freshly cultivated for miles around. It looked barren, torn, and ravaged everywhere. No more the diverse farmland of my youth. My heart grew heavy.</span></p>

No tree-lined fence. No one-room school building with tolling bell on top. No hand-water pump by the front porch. No outhouse in each back corner of the acre. No swings or basketball hoop or grass-covered yard. So many memories. Now, no sign of anything.</span></p>

Soon I could make out the farmer on the tractor. Then he came to a halt and, with obvious difficulty, climbed down from the tractor to fix something on the cultivator behind. It was apparent that arthritis had crippled his joints badly through the years. A sleeve moved loosely in the breeze —a missing arm, probably torn off in a corn sheller or combine during his youth, as so often happened with those working with heavy equipment to farm the land.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">U</span><span class="CharOverride-1">pon finishing, he stood, looked my direction, and waved his good arm. I waved back. He climbed slowly onto his tractor and continued on until fading slowly into the distance once again, the rumble of the tractor eventually becoming just a murmur.</span></p>

When I hear a song I associate with my past, I see the scenery of that past come alive again. When I think of Seth Hanson’s music, I think of dormitory basements. I’ve seen lots of musicians play in basements. Most of them got drunk and yelled. Seth was different; his show was both subdued and exciting, each song featuring new guest vocalists and musicians who helped make an enlivening performance of a bunch of melancholy, introspective songs. I saw Seth play many times after that basement set my first year at Grinnell College. With each performance his music grew on me. His meditations on life, on family, on his surroundings, deceptively simple, kept returning to me.</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span></p>

My perception of the prairie region and Midwest at large was largely shaped by a few negative stereotypes; Iowa in particular seemed to me a flat, culturally milquetoast place that people only noticed when presidential candidates came to play acoustic guitars on top of tractors and woo farmers by eating corn. My only exposure to prairie culture that existed as something outside of pastiche was that of the </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-56">Prairie School of architecture</span></a><span class="CharOverride-48">. When I was a child my mother, an architectural historian, took me to buildings designed by </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-56">Louis Sullivan</span></a><span class="CharOverride-48">, </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-56">Frank Lloyd Wright</span></a><span class="CharOverride-48">, </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-56">Marion Mahony</span></a><span class="CharOverride-48"> and </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-56">Walter Burley Griffin</span></a><span class="CharOverride-48">, and other prairie-adjacent architects. Designed with strong horizontal lines and thick beams meant to blend organically with their surroundings, these buildings, ornamented yet stark, full of light yet heavy, spoke to me. They felt informed by a world that I did not know. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-2">T</span><span class="CharOverride-48">here’s a generic image that the word “prairie” evokes—meadows, glutted with Indiangrass, dry in autumnal light and extending in all directions. Compass plants rise above the grass and follow the sun. Sparrows dart. This image is certainly not wrong; the time I spent on restored native prairie largely fit the picture. It is, to a degree, what the Prairie School was trying to capture—wide, open expanses full of air and light rising out of soil choking with flora. Yet it is not, alone, what “prairie” means, or should mean. The prairie is the dynamic cultural interaction that occurs between people and the land of the tallgrass region of North America. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-2">H</span><span class="CharOverride-48">ow closely the Prairie School truly aligned itself with this dynamic interaction is questionable. At the peak of their careers, Frank Lloyd Wright left the prairie for Europe, Walter and Marion Mahony Griffin for Australia. I reference the Prairie School, though, because it is the only obvious example of a mainstream movement within the arts that takes up the prairie moniker. Coming to Iowa for college has changed my perception of the Midwest; I now recognize it as a region whose cultural diversity and depth frequently go unrecognized on the national level. What remains yet mysterious to me is what this word “prairie” really means for the culture around me, especially as so much of the physical tallgrass prairie has vanished. Living in rural Iowa has profoundly impacted my aesthetic as a poet and artist—I find myself increasingly drawn to minute details and wide-open spaces. When I became an associate editor for </span><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk</span><span class="CharOverride-48"> this spring, I found myself trying to pin down what exactly I found so appealing but ineffable about the prairie. Bereft of any answer myself, I returned to Seth’s music.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-2">S</span><span class="CharOverride-48">eth Hanson makes music rooted in place. His latest album, </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-57">Not Too Deep</span></a><span class="CharOverride-48">, released last summer, reflects Grinnell, Iowa, on a variety of levels. It captures the scenography of life in a rural prairie town—car windows opening in the spring warmth, a family walking by an artificial lake, a group of friends playing music on a couch. </span><span class="CharOverride-45">Not Too Deep</span><span class="CharOverride-48"> also features field recordings—Grinnell and the prairie appear auditorily as well as lyrically. Seth released </span><span class="CharOverride-45">Not Too Deep</span><span class="CharOverride-48"> right after he moved from the prairie region, where he had lived all his life, to Boston, Massachusetts. The album is not only a reflection of his life in prairie towns, but of his musings about moving away from them. As my time at Grinnell College draws to a close, I find myself thinking about and listening to </span><span class="CharOverride-45">Not Too Deep</span><span class="CharOverride-48"> regularly. Like the architecture of the Prairie School, it has a levity that I treasure. I interviewed Seth recently to get his thoughts on how place impacts art. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> I’m interested in how artmaking relates to place. Part of the allure of <span class="CharOverride-27">Not Too Deep</span>, for me, is how your lyrics evoke a sense of timeless place. I’m thinking specifically of the last two tracks of the album—the first about leaving Grinnell and the latter about staying. Are you still writing music now that you’re living in Boston? Does it feel different from Grinnell or Northfield, Minnesota, where you grew up?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Hanson:</span> I am still writing music, though it took me a little while before things had settled in enough that I felt ready to start processing things into songs. I personally don’t feel particularly different (yet), so the songwriting process doesn’t feel too different either. I have still been writing observationally, so certainly some of my new Boston experiences have made their way into the content of the songs, but I guess I’ve managed to find a life here that doesn’t feel too different from my life in Grinnell. Back when I was writing songs in Northfield, I was not writing quite so observationally or introspectively, so a lot of those songs feel very different to me now, much more distant.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> What you said about observational writing is interesting. What do you think made you shift into writing songs that are observational concerning your surroundings? How much of it do you think was your surroundings versus simply growing and changing as a songwriter?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Hanson: </span>Certainly a lot of those changes happened after moving to Grinnell, but I would attribute them most to personal growth, which then filtered into songwriting growth. I do think it was Grinnell (the space, the people, the feeling of it) that created the opportunities for that change... the change being that I began to see little things around me and in my life that I felt were worth sharing, which I had not seen as such before.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> I’m interested in how musicians and artists use field recordings in their work. It seems like the ultimate observational way of writing. You use a recording of a train on the last track of <span class="CharOverride-27">Not Too Deep</span>. Have you done other field recordings? Do you think <span class="CharOverride-27">Not Too Deep</span> was impacted by the sounds of Grinnell and the prairie?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Hanson:</span> I was definitely thinking about and reacting to the sounds of Grinnell while writing those songs. That recording is of a train on the east-west track, recorded from the apartment I had downtown, so it is exactly how I would hear it from my home. From the same window, I also recorded the sounds of Broad Street for the track “Spring,” which is about looking out my window on an early spring morning. Nothing too deep about that one. But when I listen to the track now I am so happy I took the time to make that recording and include it because it brings me right back to those little peaceful moments. I have always appreciated field recordings for their ability to add depth to a mix and ground a recording in the feeling of a specific place, though I haven’t used them much. But I think, to a similar if more subtle degree, all of my recordings have been made in bedrooms and living rooms— in the same places that I lived. I enjoy having the faint imprint of those rooms on the recordings as another little note documenting the context of the recordings and my life at the time they were made.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-40">Rootstalk:</span> I like what you said about having the “faint imprint” of your life at the time of recording in your music; obviously location impacts any sort of artmaking to a degree. Do you think that there’s a particular aesthetic to music that’s written in the prairie region that’s different from that of the Midwest in general?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Hanson:</span> I guess I don’t feel particularly aware of what is happening in “Midwestern music”.... I don’t really know how to answer that...sorry.</p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-2">I </span><span class="CharOverride-2">left my interview with Seth Hanson feeling more knowledgeable about his process as a musician, and less clear about what the prairie aesthetic is. I took this question to Rachel Eber, a friend and musician who helped Seth to record </span><span class="CharOverride-1">Not Too Deep</span><span class="CharOverride-2">. The two had met at a crossing point in their lives; Rachel had just moved from Boston to Grinnell, Seth was about to leave Grinnell for Boston. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Eber:</span> I don’t think that there is a specific prairie aesthetic. I think that all musicians are all pretty different, the prairie aesthetic maybe is folk music, or at least is what I would think of, but I don’t think people from this region necessarily write the same kind of music. I think whatever prairie aesthetic means is different from just the Midwest. The town of Grinnell, to me, has been very inspiring just in terms of what it feels like to walk around and see the same places during different times of the year and stuff like that... and that’s definitely very specific to Grinnell and being a very small town in the Midwest, and that’s definitely connected to the prairie region. One thing I’ve been thinking about is being at Grinnell the school and in Grinnell the town. I think both are so small that the music scene is immediately recognizable. It’s held together by the fact that we’re all together in a small town. I think that’s something pretty special and different about being in a small town, in terms of a music scene, than being in Boston, when you could hear a new band anytime.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">&#9;&#9;</span>I listen to Seth when I want to hear songs about Grinnell; it is not like New York City or something where I could listen to anyone. What that means is that each individual song becomes a lot more powerful and embodies a lot more things. Using New York, you might see a landmark and be like “Oh yes, so many people have written about this landmark,” and it might remind you of a song or many different songs but I think Grinnell, being small, has fewer things that would catch your eye...so when they do catch your eye it’s a bigger deal. I feel like there’s probably not many people besides Seth who would write a song about sitting on a bench in Miller Park. Songs about small towns often feel a lot more personal than songs about places that tons of people have been. </p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-2">I</span><span class="CharOverride-2">n follow-up questions, neither Rachel nor Seth indicated that there was a clear or specific impact the prairie had had on their songwriting. Rather, it was the small prairie towns, and the people they encountered in those towns, that left a tangible mark on their music. At first I was disappointed by what I found. Small towns are not unique to the prairie region. Neither Seth or Rachel seemed comfortable being described as Midwestern</span><span class="CharOverride-48">—</span><span class="CharOverride-2">let alone as prairie</span><span class="CharOverride-48">—</span><span class="CharOverride-2">musicians. This makes sense. I don’t feel comfortable being described as a Southern writer, however much my childhood in the South may reach into or shape the writing I produce while living in the Midwest. If the prairie is, as I wrote earlier, the dynamic cultural interaction that occurs between people and the land of the tallgrass region, then perhaps it cannot be distilled into a singular “aesthetic.” For, like Rachel and Seth, the prairie moves. Its foliage shifts in color and form with every new season. When you drive down Iowa’s roads, you see prairie plants rising anew in areas that were newly mowed. It cannot be stilled. This is what makes it ineffable. </span></p>

When I took a graduate course on Thoreau, I already knew that he had spent most of his life in and around his home town of Concord, Massachusetts, and that his experiment in living a simple and deliberate life in the woods at Walden Pond had influenced conservationist movements around the world. Likewise, I knew that his “</span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Resistance to Civil Government</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1">” had become a handbook for all who would attempt to bring about political and social change, including </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Mahatma Gandhi</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> and </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> I was not aware, however, of Thoreau’s impact on modern architecture until I took the graduate course on his work. When I learned about his influence, I was intrigued. Many years later I was able to implement his ideas when I built a reproduction of his cabin near my home on the shores of </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Geneva Lake</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> in southern Minnesota.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">L</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ike me, many readers of Walden are unaware of Thoreau’s impact on modern architecture. When he described building his home at Walden Pond in a few pages of the first chapter, he laid the groundwork for an organic theory of architecture. A century later his theories took root on the prairie through the homes designed by </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Frank Lloyd Wright</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1">, and Wright’s early homes were part of the </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Prairie School </span></a><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">of Architecture</span><a href=""><span class="CharOverride-1"> </span></a><span class="CharOverride-1">that he inaugurated.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">W</span><span class="CharOverride-1">hen Thoreau built his one room home for a total of $28.12½, he used recycled materials from a shanty and did most of the work himself. In stating that a house should be built around the inhabitants’ needs using natural materials of earth and nature’s colors so that it becomes part of the natural environment, he expressed a couple of fundamental elements of organic architecture. He also said that “all men should have the pleasure of building their own homes.” His home, a 10’ x15’ structure, satisfied his simple needs. It contained a fireplace, a single bed, a writing table, and three chairs (one for solitude, two for friendship, and three for society). His home—and he called it his home and not his cabin—fit beautifully into the natural environment at Walden Pond. He asked his readers to consider “how slight a shelter is absolutely necessary” and further stated that “[t]he most interesting dwellings in this country, as the painter knows, are the most unpretending, humble log huts and cottages of the poor community.” I suspect Thoreau would be somewhat amused and pleased by the current tiny house movement where his ideas, whether known to the occupants or not, are being implemented.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">M</span><span class="CharOverride-1">y newly discovered information about Thoreau’s views on architecture increased my interest in the designs of Frank Lloyd Wright as seen through his Prairie School. As a result, I toured </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Taliesen East</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> in Spring Green, Wisconsin, and the </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Stockman home</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> in Mason City, Iowa. The connections with Thoreau became very clear during these visits. Wright has been called an “earth son,” a description he appreciated, and one that Thoreau would have appreciated as well. The principle</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> </span><span class="CharOverride-1">that “form follows function”—first expressed by Wright’s onetime mentor </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Louis Sullivan</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1">—echoes Thoreau’s idea about building a home based on the inhabitants’ needs. In order to do this, Wright was known to stay with a family before he began designing a home for them. Wright also believed that a building should reflect its natural environment. His prairie style houses, exemplified by </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Robie House</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> in Chicago, were long and horizontal with cantilever overhangs in order to blend with the prairie landscape. Even when Wright designed homes in other parts of the county, such as </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Fallingwater</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> in western Pennsylvania, he incorporated the structure into the natural surrounding; for example, Fallingwater is built around a waterfall rather than merely near it, and it reflects the colors of the rhododendron in the fall. His two architectural schools, Taliesen East in Wisconsin and </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">Taliesen West</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> in Arizona, were designed to reflect their native environments and use the natural colors of their areas.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">L</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ike Thoreau, Wright believed that people should learn by doing. Thoreau was amazed that he was never required to get in a boat when he took a course in navigation at Harvard, and he was determined to build his own home for his experiment in simple living. Likewise, students at Wright’s schools lived together, worked together, studied together and were expected to help with the everyday operations of the facilities, a much more practical approach than that of a typical college or university. “If you have built castles in the air your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put foundations under them,” wrote Thoreau, and Wright encouraged his students to do the same.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">L</span><span class="CharOverride-1">earning by doing became real to me when I took a course titled “Build Thoreau’s Cabin” at the </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">North House Folk School</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> in Grand Marais, Minnesota, during Memorial Day weekend in 2003. The opportunity to take an actual course in building a reproduction of Thoreau’s home attracted me. For five full days, nine other students and I worked with an instructor building a cabin. It was built in a remote and wooded area rather than on campus, and the learning was hands-on. In the few times the instructor needed to give a “lecture,” he used a piece of plywood and a carpenter’s pencil rather than a power-point, an approach Thoreau would have appreciated. We learned the basic use of a carpenter’s tools as well as the means of designing and constructing our own buildings.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">T</span><span class="CharOverride-1">wo years before taking that course, I had purchased four and a half acres of woods on Geneva Lake in southern Minnesota, and the main house was constructed in 2002. The building lot was kept small in order to keep the house surrounded by woods. The house itself has a prow front with sliding glass doors facing the lake. Each door is complemented by a Wright window on each side, and the cedar siding was stained to match the surrounding woods. For Wright, an inhabitant of a home should not be able to tell where the house ends and nature begins. Now, on this lot, I had a perfect place to build a structure like Thoreau’s. The reproduction is the exact size of Thoreau’s home—10’ x 15’—but the roof has a greater pitch than his in order to allow a loft to be included; this works well when the cabin is used as a guest house. The interior is different from Thoreau’s, and the cabin is placed so that the front without windows faces the main house. The side windows, recycled from the main house, face the woods, and one of them faces the lake beyond the woods. Former students had already named my new home </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Walden West,</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> and they were pleased to see that Thoreau’s home at Walden was being re-created.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">I </span><span class="CharOverride-1">began the actual project in the late summer of 2003, and the house was framed and enclosed before the snow flew. The supplies cost about $3,000, which would be the approximate cost of Thoreau’s expenses if inflation is calculated at four percent per year since 1845. A number of graduates from Albert Lea High School volunteered their labor, so there was no cost for that element. The interior of the cabin was completed in the spring of 2004. Since that time, I have given presentations about Thoreau, his philosophy, and the building of the cabin to high school groups and community organizations such as the </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-1">American Association of University Women</span></a><span class="CharOverride-1"> (AAUW). Many former students have toured the cabin, and some have stayed in it with their families. The cabin has become relatively well known in the area, and the local newspaper did an article about it in 2006.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">B</span><span class="CharOverride-1">oth Thoreau and Wright believed a person needs a strong connection to place, and that a house became a home when it was designed to fit the needs of the occupants rather than vice-versa. In addition, the house itself needs to be at home in nature by reflecting the natural environment of its location. Home, then, becomes a place where a person is completely comfortable in his or her environment, and that environment is grounded and reflected in the beauty of nature surrounding the home. According to Thoreau’s and Wright’s thinking, </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Walden West</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> at Geneva Lake is my home in the truest sense of the word, and the cabin has become an important part of my sense of place. Even though only parts of the original foundation of Thoreau’s home remain at Walden Pond, he now has a home on the prairie.</span></p>

Although she herself is not from the Midwest, her time at Grinnell College and her parents’ Midwestern childhoods have helped her to feel a deep-rooted connection to the area. She frequents Iowa City during her time at school, and  the time she has spent in her father’s hometown has enabled her to get better acquainted with the stories of her family.

My </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Dada</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> was one of those students, and my family one of those families. Iowa in 1967 was not equipped to, nor was it conscious of, maintaining space for Indian food, lifestyles, and culture. That trailmaking for the Indian community that exists in Iowa City now was in part due to those five Indian families who, despite being in the middle of prairie and cash-crop corn, learned to find ways to continue to cook Indian food and live as a close-knit community.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">W</span><span class="CharOverride-1">hen my </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Dada</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> moved to Iowa City, he subsisted on a </span><span class="CharOverride-2">dabba</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> containing spices from India to maintain a tie from home. By the time my </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Dadi</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, my father, and my  </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Bua </span><span class="CharOverride-1">joined him in 1968, there were enough Indian families to buy Indian spices through the post. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Dada:</span><span class="CharOverride-27">  You see, I got some spices from India when we came so I had a…</span>Masala dabba<span class="CharOverride-27"> we call it, some spices. But there was no way I could get the grocery from India so [laughs] I had to buy them here. Basically [only] a few items were available and I was able to just cook those. I came in ‘67, and [Dadi] came in February ‘68. And at that time there were five Indian families in town. So all these five Indian families will get together, and we used to [order] grocery from New York. And at  that time, if you order more than twenty-five dollar worth of grocery the postage was free. And one family couldn’t afford to get the grocery of twenty-five dollars because twenty-five dollar was at that time, was a lot of money.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-27">&#9;So each family will contribute five dollars and order for twenty-five dollars and then we just used to split all those things. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">S</span><span class="CharOverride-1">omething as simple as free postage brings people together. I like to think that it was the simplicity of it all that made those bonds so tight. Although in the short- term my family may out of simple necessity have bonded with the people around them who shared their looks, their food, and their culture, it came to mean decades of those same Friday night dinners. Eventually, coming together was no longer about finding space for Indian food in Iowa. However, those nights of food and cards remained the way to swap methods for adapting Indian dishes with new ingredients, for watching each other’s children and grandchildren, and for cultivating family away from family.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">I </span><span class="CharOverride-1">didn’t grow up in that core community, but I grew up on its stories and traditions. Visiting Iowa City from my hometown in California was always a window back into that familial past. When my family would get together and snack on </span><span class="CharOverride-2">chaat</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> or have big cups of </span><span class="CharOverride-2">chai</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, there would always be stories about the big weekend potlucks.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Bua:</span><span class="CharOverride-27"> &#9;Oh, growing up it’s like Friday came and you know</span><span class="CharOverride-1">—</span><span class="CharOverride-27">you were like “Ok, who’s house are we going to dinner at?”</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">C</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ontinuously hearing those stories, I have always been struck by the parallels to how my family operates now; long dinner tables (covered in a Fabindia tablecloth), the regular dishes: </span><span class="CharOverride-2">aloo gobi, raita, chaval, kaddu, poori</span><span class="CharOverride-1">…. The same people, lined up along the sides of each table; sometimes nine, sometimes thirteen, sometimes twenty-something. The same conversations about sales at different supermarkets, and updates on different relatives’ lives. Every dinner had multiple courses. The actual meal was usually followed by multiple rounds of fruit and </span><span class="CharOverride-2">chai</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, met with protests of “Oh no, I’m too full,” followed by everyone somehow finding room for more food. The decks of cards for </span><span class="CharOverride-2">teenpatti</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> would be whipped out sometime around ten o’clock, and round after round would begin, until at last the people who had abandoned the game were sleeping on the floor and had to be dragged home. Although we now end the night at two or three in the morning, it used to be different. When my father was growing up kids used to spend the night at the house of whomever was hosting.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Bua:</span> <span class="CharOverride-27">“...whose house are we going to dinner at?” ’Cause you knew that’s where you were having breakfast.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">A</span><span class="CharOverride-1">lthough I never attended the weekly potlucks that happened every Friday night as my father was growing up, I still start and end my nights with my family the same way he did: by sitting down at a familiar table, overeating and playing cards until two in the morning. Although I never ate the marshmallow </span><span class="CharOverride-2">rasmalai</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> my Dadi attempted to make in one of her many kitchen experiments, I did eat </span><span class="CharOverride-2">pooris</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> made by frying store-bought tortillas (another kitchen experiment). </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">A</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ccording to many members of my family, passing down recipes is not a large part of how they think about food. Although foodways are passed down, it is not through an ordered sense of tradition. After she passed away, I remember my </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Dadi</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> through how her food tasted, how she particularly favored one spice over another. Anytime I tried to learn to cook from her, she insisted that I feel out how much of each ingredient to put in (she never measured!)—the point was to understand how to use each spice to create a dish, not to recreate her way of cooking exactly. I know that no one will ever make a dish the way she did. It is a different kind of history, but it is one that I value above having recipe cards of her food.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Dada:</span> <span class="CharOverride-27">So in India, again, we don’t have these recipes, nothing like that. Once you know how to make potatoes, then you can make zucchini, you can make any vegetable just once you know. You need to learn only one vegetable, and then you can make all of them. Same thing with daal, if you know how to make one daal, you can make all daals like that. So...so it was simple. I think</span>, <span class="CharOverride-27">cooking here. I don’t know why they think it is so complicated, because they have to go through recipes and we don’t have.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">I </span><span class="CharOverride-1">would say that there is a lot of recently-developed history in the food traditions that my family and extended family hold. And there is a tradition that can be created without intention—tradition that is simply made through love and generosity towards family. My </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Dadi</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> and her friends (my father’s and my </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Bua</span><span class="CharOverride-1">’s aunties) would talk about these traditions as simple parts of life. All of these events, the cooking large dinners for everyone, finding ways to make Indian food out of American food, were never considered tradition or the start of tradition. Rather, they were a part of everyday life living as an Indian in Iowa City. And yet, those everyday aspects of life in the 60s have persisted even now. And even though cooking is supposedly not passed down all that often, cooking was learned, and was shared within the Indian community. It became an impromptu family, and a family that unintentionally blended cultural traditions of passing down food.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Bua: </span><span class="CharOverride-27">    Even Aunty talks about it—they [Dadi and others] talk about how simple life was then; how much fun it was experimenting, and you know, you discovered one thing and you’d share it with everybody, and it was just so fun.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-27">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Papa:</span><span class="CharOverride-27">  And then when new families came, they were the ones that taught everybody, that this is what you can do and this is how you make this or....</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-19">Bua: </span><span class="CharOverride-27">   And even at the hospital, Aunty came and was talking about how she learned cooking from [Dadi]. So many people learned cooking from her.&#9;</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">T</span><span class="CharOverride-1">hat is why the members of those families who are still in Iowa City are considered family, and that is why I have such a strong relationship with family and food. That same sharing that still persists now has shaped the way I have come to think about food.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">T</span><span class="CharOverride-1">here are many things that have changed about Iowa City since 1968. The airport that my father flew into no longer accepts commercial flights; when I fly into town to visit, I come through Chicago O’Hare or Cedar Rapids. One thing that I know hasn’t changed is the drive from any of those airports in February—down the highway, past snow-covered fields; spindly trees gathered in the distance, everything soft as if drawn in slightly-smudged colored pencil. Both my father’s and my first snows were in the Midwest, although his was when he stepped off a plane in Iowa City in February 1968; mine, looking out the window of his childhood house as an infant. It is these small details that make me feel connected to the history that is so important to my family.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-1">T</span><span class="CharOverride-1">he truth is, when people ask me why I came to school in the middle of Iowa, I have no way to explain that I don’t find it that odd. After all, moving from the San Francisco Bay to Grinnell in 2017 is far less outside-the-box than moving from India to Iowa City in 1968. And every time I go to Iowa City, I see how happy my family is after more than 50 years there. I see how the members of two of those four other Indian families have come to be grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins to me. I see how community developed in a place where they weren’t expected to develop, and how those deep connections remain. And I know that if my father’s family could make it that far in the prairie, then I also have a shot.</span></p>
