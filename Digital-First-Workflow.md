# Digital-First Workflow

A decision to pursue a `digital-first` publication workflow was made following much discussion in August and September, 2023.  The need for a subsequent print-edition of _Roostalk_ remains strong, so this discussion from _Slack_ is what we currently have in mind:

---
I agree, a print edition of Rootstalk should still be generated, but after the digital edition is “complete” and ready for release.  I don’t see the process of producing the print edition changing much at all, the only difference is that during production of the digital edition you, the Editor(s), will have already identified:  

- the list and order of articles,
- the single-column layout of each article including headings, indentation, etc.,
- the media within each article and the relative position of those elements within,
- the pull-quotes, and
- the end notes for each article.

So, when building for print you should be able to use the digital edition for guidance and the process, mostly with InDesign I presume, will be to:  

- break each article into a two-column layout and add page breaks,
- resize and reposition media as desired for print,
- add filler images to balance the pages,
- add the cover,
- generate and add the TOC,
- gather end notes and move them to the back of the publication (unless we elect to keep end notes with each article in print),
- pull the print issue together and produce a PDF that can be added to the digital edition.
