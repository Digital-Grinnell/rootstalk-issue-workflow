We have also developed a presence on social media, and we invite you to follow us on Facebook [facebook.com/rootstalkonline] and Twitter  [twitter.com/rootstalkonline].  We offer a special thanks to Ben Brosseau ’17 (who also was taking the class) for getting us on our feet in the world of social media.  We hope you enjoy the spring issue as much as we have enjoyed producing it!</span></p>

Engaging in this type of &quot;community work&quot; enables us, at last, to form the sort of truly educated opinions which we need to guide us in our unfolding citizenship in our region. If our community is functioning as it should, then learning to tell the prairie&apos;s stories becomes a kind of &quot;prairie restoration&quot; work, in which we tend to the soul of our home place with as much care as any work crew shows in gathering seed, weeding out invasive species, or setting back-fires during a prairie burn. </span></p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-27">Song</span><span class="CharOverride-4">:  Male indigo buntings whistle a bright, lively song of sharp, clear, high-pitched notes that lasts about two seconds. They are voluble, singing as many as 200 songs per hour at dawn and keeping up a pace of about one per minute for the rest of the day. Notes or phrases are often repeated in pairs: “what! what! where? where? see it! see it!” This pattern is recognizable, although the precise tune varies from place to place. Young indigo buntings learn their songs from males near where they settle to breed, and this leads to “song neighborhoods” in which all nearby males sing songs that are similar to each other, but that are different from those sung more than a few hundred yards away.

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I</span><span class="CharOverride-4">t was nine o’clock, breakup time for Wade MacPherson’s Wednesday breakfast group at the South of the Tracks Cafe, an unlikely mixture of two of his retired faculty colleagues, two hunting buddies, and another guy who had sat down with them a couple of years ago and joined them almost every Wednesday since. Conversation was always spirited, laced with arguments over inconsequential matters. But on this morning they had come as close to angry disagreement as he could remember. The topic was hard to avoid, CNN blaring out of the TV above the counter saw to that. Another shooter marching into another school firing ARs and automatic handguns, killing as many as he could before he is shot or shoots himself. “If more people in that room had been carrying guns he wouldn’t have killed so many people.” “No…dammit no. If one person had had no guns, no one would have died.” And so it had gone. Wade was troubled as he left the diner, started his Jeep, and headed east toward the gravel road that would take him home.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">F</span><span class="CharOverride-4">our hundred yards from his driveway he slowed his Jeep to crawl, then a stop as he looked out the dusty right window. He took off his Pheasants Forever baseball cap, scratched his head, and ran his hand over his two-day’s growth of stubble. He guessed the doe on the side of the road had been killed around dawn, he hadn’t seen it when he drove into town—likely hit by someone late to work and going too fast on the gravel. There were shattered pieces of a headlight and barely visible skid marks. At least the driver had tried to stop. He figured the deer had come out of the small timber on the south side of his little farm, or at least he called it his farm, but the only thing he really farmed on his hundred plus acres was pheasants, deer, turkeys, and prairie grass. He opened the door and got out, walked over to the deer, and ran his hand down her side. Not a lot of damage except for two broken hind legs. She was still warm, not yet stiff. He spent a long minute looking at her delicate head, beautiful long lashed eyes, tongue out with a thin trickle of blood from the side of her mouth, forming a small pool on the dry road side. He reached down and smoothed her eyes closed. He knew that legally he wasn’t supposed to move the deer, but it was going to be warm and clear, and contacting the DNR would probably take half the day and the meat would begin to spoil. She wasn’t a large animal, not very heavy, so he didn’t have much trouble, even at his age, dragging her across the road.  A little tougher to get her through the ditch and under the fence, but within five minutes he had her in the small clearing, carpeted with maple and walnut leaves, in the center of his timber. He took out and opened his lock back folder he had sharpened two days earlier, checking its edge with his thumb just to make sure he had done a good job.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">H</span><span class="CharOverride-4">e straightened the doe, moving the legs, front forward and rear back, and made a long incision from back to front about five inches from the center of her belly, careful to cut skin only and not pierce the abdominal wall. Slowly he cut and peeled the skin back and over until he reached the ridge of her backbone so that the skin, hair side down, almost seemed like a picnic cloth as he detached it. He skinned the hindquarter and shoulder, throwing the skin into the bushes at the clearing’s edge, satisfied that he had taken everything off he needed to, leaving the meat clean and exposed. He ran the blade of his knife the length of the deer’s spine, cutting from the base of her neck to the point where the ribs ended and, after making a parallel cut along its lower edge, peeled the two-foot long loin out with his fingers and laid it on his “picnic cloth.” The rump roast, which he was able to remove almost perfectly as one piece of muscle, looked like an undersized football. The shoulder came off with its bone intact, and he removed the rest of the meat from the exposed side in random pieces to be ground later or cut up for stew, sausage, or jerky.</span></p>

He liked the process of making these animals into food, liked the knowledge that nothing was being wasted, liked to think that getting his food this way was good for him and, he thought, good for, or at least did no harm to the planet. He couldn’t remember the last time he had bought meat at a grocery store.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">H</span><span class="CharOverride-4">e thought back on his hunt the previous week. It had been early in the season, only his third time out. He usually didn’t kill his buck that early, but what a lovely hunt it had been. There was a light drizzle, just a heavy fog really, but the ground was wet and there was enough early morning light to allow him to get into his stand with no noise at all. He saw no deer for the first hour, but there were nuthatches, chickadees, woodpeckers, and squirrels. At seven thirty a small parade of six adolescent raccoons ambled by in a perfectly straight line, fading into the mist toward some destination known only to them.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">round eight-ten he saw the first deer, a small fork horn that looked a bit worse for the wear, as if he had already been in a couple of scuffles with bucks he should have scrupulously avoided. Almost immediately a second buck, much bigger, with antler points going in all directions like some kind of overfed thorn bush, appeared and went for the little interloper, intent on chasing him out of his territory. Wade made a grunting sound, almost as if he was clearing his throat, and stopped the bigger deer, but only for the briefest moment, before it disappeared after the yearling. He took his rattling antlers off the limb where they had been hanging since the beginning of the season, gave them a couple of light ticks, waited a couple of beats, then really whanged them together two or three times making a sound not unlike a minor car crash. Almost immediately bushy head came crashing out of the trees like a rodeo bull exploding from a bucking chute, stopped ten feet from his stand dead down wind, smelled him, saw him, and was off, flag waving, into the timber the same way he came in. Wade chuckled. “Busted.”</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-5">W</span><span class="CharOverride-5">hat the hell</span><span class="CharOverride-4">, he thought, </span><span class="CharOverride-5">Maybe I’ll just make some more noise to see if there is another one crazy enough to come looking</span><span class="CharOverride-4">. And another one did, a nice buck, hair raised on his back, nostrils flared, right down the trail that would take him in front of the stand. Wade had always been attracted to the Native American idea that animals gave themselves to good and ethical hunters and that when that happened, when that chance came, and it might be rare, the hunter should take the gift. That is exactly what the deer did, crossing fifteen yards in front of his stand and stopping perfectly broadside on his grunt. Wade put the sight pins of his crossbow (he had hunted with a crossbow for the past three years, being unable to draw a bow with enough weight to be sure of a good clean kill) on the spot that would send the arrow through both heart and lungs, and pulled the trigger. The buck barely flinching, trotted fifty yards up the slope, stopped, looked around, and collapsed. Before he could climb down from his stand there was more noise and crashing of limbs and another buck, the biggest Wade had ever seen, charged in front of his stand looking for a brawl. Thrilled at just being able to see the monster, he stopped him with another grunt and then watched him wander down the trail and out of sight. Wade laughed out loud.  Thirty years earlier, maybe even twenty years, he would have been devastated at having missed a chance at this huge deer, but now he felt he had been allowed a second, perhaps even more valuable gift just being able to see the animal.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">N</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ow, Wade got up, stretched again, and rolled the doe on to her other side. When he had repeated what he had done on the first side he walked back to his Jeep, got a tarp and some rope. He wrapped the meat, dragged the carcass into the brush at the edge of the clearing where an eagle might see it and the coyotes could smell it, and drove to his house.  </span></p>

Not superficially alone. He saw people, had lunches, fishing buddies, the breakfast guys. Old students, some of whom he had taught to hunt, would come by from time to time and they would talk for half a day, he asking the questions now, payment for any shreds of knowledge he might have given them at some gone by time. But he was profoundly alone. </span></p>

She had died the way she had always said she’d wanted to, quick, with no pain—at least no pain she had let him see. But she had died too soon, oh Lord she had died too soon. “Got our meat for the winter.” He still talked to her in the kitchen. He almost told her how he had gotten the meat, knew she’d have been interested, maybe proud, but by then he had made it to the basement.</span></p>

He had loved guns ever since he was six years old and he shot his grandpa’s sixteen gauge Ithaca double for the first time. He had cried from the kick and had to endure kidding about that shot ever since. “Bang—waaaaa” from his uncle, or any one else in his family, whenever hunting or shooting entered a conversation. It was that uncle who had taken him into the woods with a Colt Woodsman twenty-two. They shot tin cans off fence posts and puffballs to watch them smoke. They would go to the dump and shoot rats (or rather shoot at rats, since he couldn’t remember hitting a single one), watching them dive for cover in the garbage. He remembered his first squirrel, his first rabbit, and much later his first quail. “You kill it, you eat it,” his uncle would say. And his mother, “if you clean it I’ll cook it.”</span></p>

He liked the smell of gun smoke, of gun oil, of Hoppes’ Number 9 solvent. He liked the musical note of spent shells ejecting from a bolt action, the ka-chunk of a pump chambering a round, the four clicks of a hammer being cocked on a single action army. He liked the delicate engraving on a fine shotgun, the smooth machined perfection of a good automatic, the intricately figured grain in a walnut butt stock. He liked the solid weight of a rifle and the way a revolver fit his hand and bucked when he fired it. He liked knowing that a good gun would last many lifetimes, would retain, even gain value, would not need to be replaced in a year, or a month, by a newer model. He knew the mantra well, “Guns don’t kill people—people kill people.” He had heard it that very morning. </span></p>

On the top shelf were his handguns—five handguns. Five handguns. He thought of the joke called a training class he had taken to get a legal carry permit so he could take a pistol hunting or to the target range without having to lock it in the back of his vehicle. “There are three kinds of people in this country,” the instructor had said, “the sheep, the wolves, and the sheep dogs who protect the sheep from the wolves. We are the sheep dogs.” </span></p>

He took each pistol out, held it, and pulled the trigger on an empty chamber, then put them all back except for a Ruger Red Hawk forty-four magnum revolver and a Kimber forty-five automatic. He had owned the revolver for years, carried it as “bear protection” for his annual solo camping trips into the Rockies, even though he knew that an aerosol can of pepper spray was a surer and safer way to keep a bear from punching you around or having you for lunch. Still, its weight felt reassuring. It felt good to have it lying beside his sleeping bag. And it was a hell of a hunting handgun. The Kimber—he wasn’t sure why he had it. He’d traded for it at a gun show. Thought he’d gotten a deal. It was a beautiful gun, brushed stainless steel with checkered walnut handles. Maybe that was the reason. But it had no range. It was only good for very close up shooting. At what? Most likely a person—a very close person.  He held the two guns for a long moment. “Two out of five,” he thought. “That’s a start.”</span></p>

He walked over to his work bench, put a small anvil in the bag, and zipped it up. He knew what he was going to do but he was moving almost as if compelled by something other than his own volition. He got in the Jeep, put the bag in the seat beside him, drove a half-mile down the gravel road, turned into a small grove of cottonwoods, and shut off the ignition. He had left a sledge hammer by the gate while doing some fence work earlier in the week. He grabbed it and his range bag and walked along a path mowed through prairie grass, plum thickets, and young oaks, stopping to watch a rooster pheasant and two hens flush as he came over a low rise. In five minutes he was facing a dirt road that bisected his property, a shallow ditch on one side and a steep bank covered with gone to seed cone flowers and blazing star on the other. Scattered all over were obsolete TV sets, a vacuum cleaner, a kitchen chair and half a table, and black garbage bags full of trash. Some slobs had thrown it there the week before. He had intended to take it all to the dump but now it had one final use. He lined the TVs on the bank, stood the vacuum cleaner up, and put a clip in the automatic.</span></p>

He was closer on the second and the third was dead center on the screen. He marveled at the small size of the hole it made, but didn’t all the detective novels say “small hole in front and the one in the back is big enough to put your fist in without getting blood on your fingers.” The next shots were better but the Kimber was anything but deadly accurate in his hands. He put in a second clip and emptied it as fast as he could. Blam, blam, blam. He began to chuckle. After reloading the clips he turned his back to the junk. It was attacking him from behind, he had to protect himself. That’s what these guns are for isn’t it? To protect ourselves and our families and our country against… junk television sets. He whirled and emptied two clips into the next TV and this time he laughed as the screen exploded. The only thing that could have made this more fun would have been to have dumb commercials playing on the sets. Two more forty-five rounds left.  “Ah, ha, the vacuum cleaner. It’s coming after my old Granny. I’m a sheep dog. Got to protect her.” Blam, blam. Slowly the old Hoover toppled and rolled down the bank. He was so overcome with laughter he </span>had to sit down. Wade MacPherson was keeping his country safe.</p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I </span>worked just over two months on <a href="http://mustardseedfarm.org"><span class="Hyperlink">Mustard Seed Community Farm</span></a> as an “agro-ecology intern”. I think the full two months was in order to allow outdoor rural Iowa to deprogram me from the alienated technology-saturated life I had been leading, and to get me acquainted with the more raw conditions of living. The farm&apos;s setting is quite a bit more rural than Grinnell, about twelve miles north of Ames which is a city of about 60,000 (although over half are Iowa State students who migrate with the academic cycle). Both Nate and Alice, who are the primary owners and operators of the farm, have part-time jobs at a cooperative in Ames, and they could drive me to town on weekends. Otherwise, Story City<span class="CharOverride-4">—</span>a town of about 2,000<span class="CharOverride-4">—</span>is only about seven miles away, and I would bike there every weekend with my laptop in my backpack to a cute little independent, goat-themed coffee shop to use the wifi and take care of my duties on the cybernetic grid. To provide me with small dosages of internet or calling, my phone could usually pick up 4G on the farm, and there are a couple outlets, though not many, for power. </p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he immediate location of the farm and its surroundings is, in my view, pretty great. Iowa may not have the best natural landscape, considering that so much of the state is developed, but it does have a monopoly on gorgeous, expansive skies. At times they are golden, other times celestial and bluish purple with elegant clouds seemingly hiding a magical, floating kingdom. Rainbows at times arc above the fields; I once saw a double rainbow over the prairie while a lightning bolt ignited the air. The summer greens clash vibrantly with the blues and golds and the feeling of vastness in open space would be enough to scare the pants off of any agoraphobe. The farm is bordered on three sides by large -scale family farms (which, like most family farms, follow industrial monoculture practices), so you kind of grasp the magnitude of opposition to the sustainable way of life. Mustard Seed is a little ten-acre island in a sea of 1,000-acre operations. But across the gravel road from the farm is some fantastic natural prairie and forest land, owned by a family that allows interns to explore. A large creek flows through it, and as long as you bring long pants to thwart the thistles, you can hike around the bluffs it has carved into the landscape. Several acres of the farm are devoted to prairie restoration and buffering pesticide and fertilizer runoff from the surrounding industrial operations. An artificial pond, recently stocked with fish and surrounded by cattails and other native plants, served as a cooling swimming hole. It occupies the side of the farm primarily devoted to rehabilitation of the land. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he farm itself really got me thinking about sustainability, and I discovered that it  had the capacity to alter my way of living. During my internship, we washed our clothes by hand and our showers were outdoors, with solar heated water. There was no indoor plumbing; only an outhouse with a toilet seat constructed over a bucket which we periodically emptied into a designated pit, its contents meant to be buried and, after two years, the land sown with inedible plants like flowers. I shared a small, uninsulated loft with a steel roof and a wooden floor, above an outdoor kitchen where we cooked the majority of our meals. The roof was too low to allow standing up, but the mattress was comfortable. A set of screened windows kept out many insects, but a few managed to breach our living quarters. Toward the end of June and throughout July, the small compartment was as hot as an oven—one day it was 97°F, not that bad until you factor in the 97 percent  humidity—so we would seek shelter in the kitchen, where the shade and airflow refreshed the body. I finished several books in the shade, including </span><span class="CharOverride-5">Moby Dick,</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> which seemed oddly fitting amid the agricultural sea of corn.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he farm made me realize how simple living can be, and how much waste “normal” life generates. The focus I found of the farm was to contribute as little as possible to the injustices of the world while simultaneously maximizing positive contributions.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">O</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ur daily work consisted of planting, weeding, harvesting, and organizing, and we watered a large variety of fruits and vegetables. There was a lot of crouching in the dirt, contorting our bodies so as to not trample any fragile plants. Potatoes were a soggy business. In groups, we would spread decaying leaves over hand-made ditches as mulch for moisture retention and nutrients. The slight elevation of the potato patch and the blazing sun kept the soil dry and hard, requiring significant blows with the steel-bladed hoe. Sometimes I got to lead teams on harvest days after I had grown accustomed to the process. I learned such meditative skills as how to mow fallow land with a scythe. Evening and morning chores included doing dishes, helping make meals (with all the organic vegetables), collecting chicken eggs and turning on or off the little electric fence that keeps deer from destroying the farm&apos;s crops. Emptying the latrine bucket was the least pleasant of the chores, but it wasn’t that bad. Aside from small chores, meal prep and cleanup, the actual farm work expectation was thirty hours a week, but I could choose what days I wanted off or distribute them as I wanted. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">n average work day for me began around 8 am, though I was usually the last one up. A bell would ring in the kitchen below my bed, and I would groggily throw on work pants, shoes, a shirt, and a straw hat my grandmother had given me. I never had to check the temperature on my phone before getting dressed; I just had to sit up in bed and feel the air around me. I would open the hatch into the open air and descend the ladder, eating a protein bar I kept in a plastic bin. Usually, I would also fill my water bottle from the water jugs (refilled at the cooperative) kept in the Red Shed, a cabin-like shed with a table, chairs, and several bookshelves, a refrigerator, and a lot of storage (food, cooking supplies, tools, seeds, etc.). A couple of interns before me had written a poem on the latrine wall</span><span class="CharOverride-4">—</span><span class="CharOverride-4">a sonnet in honor of summer chard. If I had any similar legacy, it would concern the water jugs. I wrote ridiculous labels on them, such as “trombone oil,” “vodka,” and “orphan tears.” </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">B</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ut back to the routine. After getting amply hydrated, I would sit at the outdoor kitchen table with my companions, and we would discuss the day’s duties, take notes, and read the duties neglected in the days before. We would set priorities for the smooth functioning of the farm and then go out into the field. We would do things like plant cantaloupe in measured rows for a couple of hours and then switch to weeding raspberries.The fruits and vegetables we cared for fluctuated daily. The person on lunch duty would begin cooking lunch around 10:30 or 11 am, whether preparing a kale, turnip, and onion quiche, and cooking it in the farm’s solar-heated oven, or preparing a big salad full of garden veggies. We would usually break for lunch around noon. If anything was certain, that there was no shortage of good food on Mustard Seed Farm. We would say a nondenominational prayer to “Mr. E” (mystery) and lively conversation would usually ensue around the kitchen table. We would make jokes, or discuss current events or personal values. After briefly regrouping, we would move on to the next task at hand, whatever it might be until whoever was on dinner duty rang the bell signalling more good food and conversation. In the particularly dry weeks of the summer, we would water the more fragile crops with water pumped up from an underground well. Plants were watered at night to minimize evaporation. I could hear the motorized pump hum whenever I was on dish duty. Work was a great time for either conversation or meditation or a little bit of both. Thinking while accomplishing a task is rewarding. Peter Maurin, the French Catholic social activist who founded the Catholic Worker Movement with Dorothy Day in 1933, wanted to create “agricultural universities” and allow manual workers to be intellectual and intellectuals to work with their hands, to foster growth. That idea strikes me as particularly ingenious because there are certain thought patterns you can only have while you are sweatily engaged in muscling a hand plow through mammoth weeds under an enormous sky. Other brilliant ideas require quiet, restful contemplation. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">B</span><span class="CharOverride-4">efore bed I would engage with the latter on most nights, reading political philosophy such as the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek’s</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> </span><span class="CharOverride-4">correspondence with the imprisoned Russian feminist activist, Nadya Tolokonnikova, or Noam Chomsky’s short survey, </span><span class="CharOverride-5">On Anarchism.</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> I would curl up on my bed, inundated by the drone of chirping toads in the nearby pond and read under the weak light of a solar powered lamp. When I would get up in the night to use the latrine or get some water, I would always pause to gaze at the night sky over the shadow-blanketed fields, the only sounds the white noises of insects, toads, and a soft breeze. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">s far as less routine activities are concerned, I also did things like teach a class of K-3 students at a local middle school about vegetables and healthy eating. It was fun, but in my experience it&apos;s been hard enough to get my younger siblings to eat their vegetables; getting a classroom full of young children excited about them was that much harder. I had read in </span><span class="CharOverride-5">National Geographic</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> that astronauts had successfully grown lettuce at the International Space Station that led to several of our classes being space-themed. We pretended turnips and beets were comets and we helped the children make “seed meteors” out of mud, soil, and several different types of vegetable seeds. When the children threw their meteors in their yards, we told them, if enough rain fell, vegetables would sprout up. This was a kid-friendly adaption of the “guerrilla gardening” movement’s “seed bombs&quot; practice, in which a bunch of dedicated food activists and environmentalists would throw their seed bombs into public places like the median strips of highways, parks, and other areas. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I </span><span class="CharOverride-4">also helped write passages for the farm’s weekly newsletter and did some illustrations. The newsletters were distributed with boxes of food and to volunteer harvesters. From time to time</span><span class="CharOverride-4">—</span><span class="CharOverride-4">about every other week</span><span class="CharOverride-4">— </span><span class="CharOverride-4">we would have a farm team meeting, either on the farm or at team member’s house in Ames. It was always over a delicious supper with fresh vegetables. We would talk about the things we had to do on the farm,  both long term and before the next meeting, such as hosting events, conducting community outreach and public relations, renovating farm buildings, and more. Several times during the season the farm hosted community roundtables and discussions-potluck style (I learned in </span><span class="CharOverride-5">Moby Dick</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> that Americans have been saying “potluck” at least since 1852). For instance, one farm team member hosted a discussion on class issues, another on Catholicism and environmentalism. I led an on-farm discussion about left-wing ideology after a communal supper. In our free time, a couple of other interns and I went to an anti-Dakota Access pipeline protest, where we and many other demonstrators piled into canoes and protected the water in a small</span><span class="CharOverride-4">—</span><span class="CharOverride-4">but not insignificant</span><span class="CharOverride-4">—</span><span class="CharOverride-4">way. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">s for the people who will definitely be there during anyone’s internship, the farm managers, Nate and Alice, are both very nice. Nate is a bit of a paradox because he is one the chillest easy-going guys you will talk to, but at the same time he has an insane work ethic. He’s always fun to talk to about the world and farming and everything, and he knows a lot about native prairie plants and ecosystems. Alice is always super busy, but she is easy to work with and she keeps the farm functioning smoothly which is very challenging considering the incessant labor demands of low-input, sustainable organic farming. She did some really cool work with the Catholic Worker Movement in Des Moines and elsewhere. She does great things and is very interesting to talk to. Aside from those two it is really variable whom any given intern will be with. The farm team that comes for a couple of hours twice a week for harvests is somewhat stable, all very nice local people or students from Iowa State or an occasional international (I met a Turkish family and a group of African refugees). A very important factor is who interns with you. I was fortunate to be with some really cool people: a fellow Grinnellian who I became great friends with and a neighbor to the farm who came over occasionally who had just recently graduated from college. A 28 year old architect involved with the Catholic Worker Movement in Texas was also super cool. And a Buddhist friend of Alice’s came for two weeks. The mission of the farm, that everyone in the world should have good, healthy food to eat, attracts some really cool people regardless of the year to year uniqueness. Also there is a cat named Shadowbeast who is always a friendly companion.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">M</span><span class="CharOverride-4">y time on Mustard Seed Farm showed me ways to sever some of the connections that I have come to see as contributing to global, national, and local problems. In the process, I asserted myself, albeit in a minuscule way, on the side of nonviolent dissent against business as usual. I kept fuel and electricity use to a minimum, and my labor was not alienated from human welfare, because (we produced food for local consumption. I contributed to the restoration of delicate ecological relations that had long since been destroyed by industrial farming. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">O</span><span class="CharOverride-4">f course, it&apos;s hard to do any of this perfectly. I drove around with my parents for several days when they visited me from the Twin Cities, looking for fun things to do. Some of the food I ate came from unsustainable sources, but we tried to do our best with what we had, and so reduced our contribution to the problems of the world. We supplemented our farm-grown diets with expired food from the local cooperative; we ate meat, but not daily. And one third of the food we produced was donated to local clinics and food pantries. The rest was either given to workers or paying members in the local area. It seemed to me that we were trying to reduce harm maximally, but at the same time to be of the greatest help. This was in keeping with the inherently political tradition of the Catholic Worker Farm. We operated amid the reality of business as usual at all times. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">M</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ustard Seed Community Farm still must operate in larger society. But it is a beacon of dissent; an example of how we can live differently from the norm, affecting good and reducing harm, instead of merely acting with profit in mind or maintaining power or convenience. Life on the farm was therefore stressful. There were always many tasks at hand that had mostly to be done by hand or with a small arsenal of non-electric tool</span><span class="CharOverride-4">s</span><span class="CharOverride-4">. Relying on </span><span class="CharOverride-4">b</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ikes for transportation proved to be near impossible at times, or dangerous. Refraining from the convenience of washing machines and microwaves also had its temporal drawbacks, and the farm&apos;s reliance on a variable volunteer workforce and a handful of seasonal interns kept things interesting. Unavoidably, many of the farm’s tools were produced unsustainably, or in way that were exploitative of workers—but no labor is exploited in the production of the farm’s vegetables, and transgressions against humanity were kept low. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">s you can likely see, when you take the concept of interconnection to heart, almost everything bears problematic elements, enough to drive even a diligent do-gooder insane. People are often</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> </span><span class="CharOverride-4">trapped in terms of the choices are available to them. If you don’t get a job, it’s hard to support your family (especially if you don’t own land or have a benefactor); if you don’t drive to work, you get fired unless you can jump through the hoops and inconveniences of biking. At a certain point I had to recognize the inevitability of imperfection, of some small harm slipping through the cracks of justice- oriented action, but I had to keep it from discouraging me to the point that it kept me from achieving my goal of pushing back at the notion that </span><span class="CharOverride-4">the status quo can r</span><span class="CharOverride-4">eign indefinitely, that Evil triumphs and Good is pointless.

What skill could be more useful, in the face of global warming, than learning how to sustainably grow your own food? Your cooking improves, you make new friends, and you get lots of exercise. I am very happy with my experience.</span></p>

Sharing creates and sustains relationships and enhances knowledge, it protects us from ignorance. It’s powerful. It confirms identity. It helps reach goals,  increases competence, and brings rewards. And knowledge sharing, not just germplasm sharing, is going to be the other major feature here. Knowledge sharing is a fundamental process of civilization, it is central to learning, it deepens identity, and it creates community... And sharing knowledge and information about the genetic diversity in our seed banks can help farmers and breeders to enhance the sustainability and resilience of our agricultural systems.</span></p>

			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he industrialization of agriculture and the transformation of the seed industry during the last century have dramatically changed the way farmers and consumers think about and interact with our agricultural and culinary heritages. However, industrial agriculture has undermined  the once-common process of creating and maintaining local plant varieties. In response, many organizations and individuals have been trying to reconnect farmers and gardeners with this process. I have been lucky enough to be part of this effort  through my years as an employee at Seed Savers Exchange. Sharing knowledge, as Dr. McCouch said, really is the most important part of creating dynamic and resilient seed systems. Let me share with you  the story of Seed Savers Exchange, the networks that its members have created, and offer you a personal look at one family’s seed story. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I </span><span class="CharOverride-4">listened to Dr. McCouch’s speech under the shade of a large yellow tent at Heritage Farm, the 890-acre headquarters of Seed Savers Exchange. Seed Savers Exchange is an agricultural non-profit and the largest non-governmental seed bank in the United States. Seed Savers’ story began in 1975, when Diane Ott Whealy and Kent Whealy received a gift of morning glory seeds from Diane’s grandfather in Festina, Iowa. That day, Diane learned that the flowers had been passed down to her grandfather from her great-grandfather who immigrated from Germany. She immediately felt a connection to a country she had never seen and a generation of her family that she had never met. When Diane and Kent moved away from the Midwest, she took these seeds with her so that she would have a living memory of her grandparents’ garden. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">D</span><span class="CharOverride-4">iane realized when she inherited this family heirloom flower that many other Americans must have similar stories. She and Kent put out a call for gardeners to share their seeds. That first year, in 1975, thirty people shared almost a hundred varieties of seeds. As the organization grew, people began entrusting their family and community heirloom seeds to Seed Savers Exchange for preservation. Diane and Kent decided to buy a farm and make Seed Savers Exchange their life’s work.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4"> </span><span class="CharOverride-4">Over the next decade, the seed collection became so large that Seed Savers Exchange established a formal department to handle these acquisitions. The preservation department at Seed Savers Exchange now maintains a collection of over 20,000 unique varieties from over 80 crop species. This collection includes annual crops as well as perennial plants like apple trees and grapevines. Every year, the department’s curator chooses 500-800 varieties that will be grown out for evaluation. The evaluation team spends its days measuring plants, taking notes on leaf shape, flower color, and a host of other crop-specific characteristics. Crops are also grown out by the preservation department for seed regeneration. Gardeners still mail small quantities of their heirloom seeds to Seed Savers Exchange for preservation. These seeds are often accompanied with letters from grandmothers and granddaughters, fathers and sons, describing the history of the seed. The preservation department must grow out these seeds to ensure adequate population sizes for storage and future plantings. Additionally, two seed historians work to document the stories behind these varieties. The preservation department now has a staff of around fifteen people who  work together to steward the histories of the 20,000 varieties of plants that have been entrusted to Seed Savers Exchange. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I</span><span class="CharOverride-4">’ve come to realize that Seed Savers Exchange has two seed banks. One sits in a hill on the campus at Heritage Farm.  The other is not situated in a place and does not have a vault door or a thermostat or an elaborate back-up generator. That seed bank is broken into pieces that are tucked away in cupboards and pantries all around the country. The gardeners who participate in the Seed Savers Exchange are all managers of this large, dispersed seed bank. Every member holds a small fraction of the total sum of seeds in the Exchange. The value of this seed bank can be seen in the connections it creates among gardeners, the diversity it saves from disappearance, and the beauty and flavor of the countless plants that we all grow and love. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">his decentralized seed bank has a name; it is called the Yearbook. The Seed Savers Yearbook has a long history, stretching back to those original thirty gardeners who shared seeds in 1975. In 2016, more than 800 people offered more than 16,000 unique varieties through this seed exchange. The Yearbook is a 600-page volume, printed annually, that lists thousands of plant varieties offered by individual gardeners around the world. Most of these varieties are not available through any other seed catalogs or stores. In some cases, only one or two people steward these varieties and their stories. The researcher and author Renée Vellvé explains the cultural importance of seed saving and genetic diversity in this passage:</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph ParaOverride-8"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he crops we grow did not fall out of the sky. They are a living heritage. Generation after generation, people have been tailoring plants, watching them, learning from them and passing the good results on. Be it a certain potato that could withstand late spring frosts in Sweden or a radish that wasn’t so sharp that a Spaniard would find it inedible, gardeners and farming families have created, hands-on, an incredible panorama of different crop varieties to suit their own needs, customs, and tastes. And in so doing they lay their story down and give that story a name, often suggesting the plant’s origin or qualities. Just as stories have to be told, plants have to be reproduced—or they simply fade out of existence.</span><span class="CharOverride-36">2</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> </span></p>

			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I </span><span class="CharOverride-4">have learned that relationship-building and storytelling are perhaps the most important parts of seed saving. In 2015, I had the opportunity to meet three generations of a family who all share a special connection to their Italian heritage, to gardening, and to each other through the preservation of an heirloom pepper. This story is representative of hundreds of similar stories that have unfolded through Seed Savers Exchange’s network throughout the decades. But, in certain ways, this story is also exceptional. This is the story of the Ogle-Riccelli’s and the Ausilio pepper. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he story starts in the late winter of 2015 in the basement office of our preservation department. I was sitting next to our collection technician and our seed historian. They were talking excitedly about a series of documents that had just arrived. Our seed historian exclaimed that this was the most thorough documentation of any variety in our collection. Through letters, emails, and phone calls, our collection technician had gathered over 20 pages of information about the Ausilio pepper from the Ogle-Riccelli family in Des Moines, Iowa. That day, we started planning a trip to visit the Ogle-Riccellis. Although Seed Savers Exchange’s collection is composed of thousands of home-grown varieties of fruits and vegetables, we hadn’t often made time to visit the homes where those varieties were grown. Our contact with the Ogle-Riccelli’s made us want to change that, and our visit to their home was the start of a new vision for seed history documentation in our department. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">O</span><span class="CharOverride-4">n a rainy Monday in October of 2015, three colleagues and I drove through the tidy suburbs of southern Des Moines to a quiet neighborhood of brick ranch houses. We were met by Chad Ogle-Riccelli, his wife, Michele, his mother, Theresa, and his three children. They quickly walked us through the house and made their way out to the garden. They had a lot to show us. Our seed historian and our collection curator talked with Chad and Michele about their garden. I stood by and chatted with Chad’s 90-year-old mother, Theresa. Theresa remembers her parents growing and cooking with these peppers throughout her childhood. She was charmed when I pronounced her name in Italian, saying that she hadn’t heard anyone say her name like that since her parents passed away. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">heresa’s parents, Giovanni Ausilio and Rachel P. Scarcello, moved to Des Moines from Italy in the early 1900s. They met each other in their Italian-American neighborhood and were soon married. The pepper is so central to the family’s food culture that, several years ago, they created a cookbook with recipes that utilize the pepper and many photographs of Ausilio family members. When Chad and Michele invited us inside for supper, we were treated to three of these dishes. As an appetizer, we had Sardas, a savory roll made with pepper paste and anchovies. Our main course included a pasta topped with pepper sauce and spicy roasted peppers preserved in oil. We shared glasses of Italian wine and offered our gratitude for the family’s hospitality. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">fter supper, we gathered in the family’s living room. We talked for hours with Theresa about her family history and about their Italian-American neighborhood. Chad and Michele had been discussing the possibility of donating their family heirloom to Seed Savers Exchange. We talked with them about the steps we would take to preserve the seeds and their history. Ultimately, Chad and Michele said, the decision was up to grandma Theresa. They were her seeds. At the end of the night, Theresa handed us a jar of Ausilio pepper seeds. It was a quiet, sacred moment of trust. We thanked her for her stewardship of the pepper and promised her that we would cherish it and its story. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">L</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ast year, we invited the Ogle-Riccellis to visit Heritage Farm. The family stayed in the farmhouse where Kent and Diane once raised their children. Our facilities manager took them on a tour of the property; our preservation department showed them through the field where we were growing out their pepper, and the kids got to run around the farm and see hundreds of different varieties of vegetables that had been shared with us by other families like theirs. Shortly after their visit, Chad and Michele sent us three jars of canned pepper sauce, some Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and handmade Italian pasta. We cooked up a feast in our department kitchen and sat down to a traditional Ogle-Riccelli meal. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">his is what seed saving is all about. In one of the many letters he exchanged with Seed Savers Exchange, Chad wrote, “As Grandma would tell you, they are her family seeds.

What is a defining aspect of that identity.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph ParaOverride-9"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">BDULKARIM: I guess I have two answers to that question. My instinctive answer is that it’s just like asking any person what it’s like growing up in the Midwest, but the reality is that it’s like, yeah, I wear two pairs of socks in January, I have a really bad Minnesotan accent, and sometimes I get death glares depending on what the headlines have been like recently. I’ve lived in the Midwest my whole life, so I don’t know any different. This is my only reality, you know?</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph ParaOverride-9"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">BDULKARIM: I get a lot of people who don’t think I speak English, and talk to me in hand signals until I’m done laughing to myself and speak up. Those are the funny times. But the glares are poisonous. I remember when I was waiting in line to get my picture taken after I passed my driver’s test, a gentleman with his wife looked back at me, shook his head in disapproval, and scoffed. And with things like this, it’s easy to not take it personally and channel inner confidence, but I’ve had to do this since I was five years old. I’ve been attacked based on visible declarations of my faith and it’s gotten worse as I made it more visible and as the blatant ridicule and antagonization my faith has been more and more normalized. It’s exhausting—and of course, there’s that character from my senior speech who asked why my religion oppresses women. One hundred percent of the time I feel like I’m Muslim before I’m me because I feel like I need to be a positive ambassador. I feel like the weight of all the stereotypes rests on my shoulders and that I personally need to prove all of them wrong, and that’s exhausting, too.</span></p>

We didn’t eat there that day, we just went to a Chick-fil-A. My optimist mind wants to say it’s just because the population there doesn’t see people who look different that often, but I’ve been proven wrong too many times since to be confident in that assumption.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph ParaOverride-9"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">BDULKARIM: Nope, that was a totally independent decision. My parents were hesitant to send me to a residential campus in this political climate, but I always insist that I’m not willing to base my life decisions on threats posed by racists. That’s giving into their attempt to alienate and differentiate us from society. I won’t let them hold me back and turn my community into the backwards, less educated population they want and expect us to be. I hesitate to use “us”, because I belong to many “us’s”, and the Muslim community is only one of them. I don’t consider myself exclusively a part of an isolated Muslim community, nor do any Muslims I know. We’re all parts of our neighborhood, school, etc., communities as much as any other American.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph ParaOverride-9"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">BDULKARIM: I trusted that a Christian-affiliated college wouldn’t be any different than another liberal arts college, and that its defining traits and strengths had nothing to do with that affiliation (granted I’d been assured no religious curriculum or conversion efforts would be forced on anybody). I guess it turned out to be a reciprocation of what I wish people would see in me - I’m a person with unique personality traits and I want that to define me, as opposed to attracting or repelling friends solely based on my religious affiliation. And so far, I made the right decision. I often forget that mine is a Lutheran college on a day to day basis.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph ParaOverride-9"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">BDULKARIM: I’ve found a balance of daily practice and incorporate religious philosophy and perspective into my everyday life. What I like about doing this away from home is that I get to expand core religious beliefs into tiny little mindfulness exercises during my independent activities. I actually find myself strengthening my faith at college, because I’m the only one holding myself accountable for the daily prayers and small practices, etc. Islam really stresses individual connections with God, and I get a lot more of that at college. Of course, I appreciate the community aspect I get at home, but this is another flavor of religious affirmation.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph ParaOverride-9"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">BDULKARIM: I’m involved with the MSA and the Spanish Club, most formally. I don’t think the types of communities I am involved with have really changed, but the extent to which we can interact and blend on the same campus makes it a little more three dimensional. We see each other in passing when getting breakfast or when studying in the library, and seeing a familiar face that shares a cause or an interest with me makes me feel safe and understood.</span></p>

Not because Muslims deserve more marked representation than any minority, but because of the deliberate and blatantly voiced intent of borderline ethnic eradication of Muslims from this country. I made a promise to myself the night Trump was elected, and part of it was that I’d never allow myself to be treated as a second-class citizen in my country (The United States). My rights as a citizen are at stake and allowing that to happen to the Muslim denomination should be alarming to everyone, because it sets the precedent that the equal rights clause has loopholes if fear and lack of education about any group of citizens reaches a certain threshold.</span></p>

Hope is not gone, but I think I’ve already seen the best of America that I will live to see.

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph ParaOverride-9"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">BDULKARIM: It’s unfortunate, and this is a realization I’ve made at college, that half of my relationship with my religion is defending it from stereotypes, racist attitudes, and a misinformed, antagonizing stigma. My religion is one of peace, and I’ve lost sight of all the beautiful things that religion provides as a spiritual adherent because mine is under such disproportionate attack. I’m still learning to compartmentalize defense of my religion and separate it from my social activist side that wants to correct every attitude. But that’s not my job.</span></p>

It therefore baffles me when being Muslim is falsely portrayed as an anti-nationalist political statement, or any political statement at all, let alone one that would appear on an ID. One’s adopted doctrine on how to live a life and idea of how the universe was created does not formulaically dictate probability for any kind of destructive behavior; not for Islam, any more than Buddhism, Christianity, or dozens of others. So, I don’t like to entertain the idea that I have to justify my validity as an American, peaceful world citizen, or success in any academic or extracurricular area. All people should judge me for is what I do and how I treat others.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">here are battles which never make the news, at home or abroad. Yet, they are as deep and hard-fought as any you will find. The battles are over the will of the people, the dictates of a distant capital, and the struggle to maintain a sense of place in a dynamic world. In a constitutional democracy, there is an obligation to follow the law. But when some laws hurt or threaten, is there an equal mandate to resist?</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I </span><span class="CharOverride-4">spent my last year traveling and teaching in Norway as a </span><a href="http://www.cies.org/"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-4">Fulbright Scholar</span></a><span class="CharOverride-4">. My sojourns in that northern kingdom were mediated by my Wisconsin roots and an adulthood spent in Iowa. I found that the people, culture, climate, and geography of Iowa and Norway intersected in various ways—some obvious, as is so with their ethnic roots, while others are more nuanced, as with the similarities that can be found in the cultivation of salmon and the operation of Iowa hog lots. In my travels, I found that some of the same battles which we fight out on the prairies of Iowa resemble those fought out along</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> </span><span class="CharOverride-4">Norway’s fjords. These places—so geographically distant from each other—share a surprising bond in how they sometimes have to fight to maintain their identities and existence in a word which often seems to have turned its back to traditional communities.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I</span><span class="CharOverride-4">f you think Norway is a rich country with no problems, then you are mistaken. Does the Kingdom of Norway have wealth? Yes, of course. But there are pressures brought to bear on its society by the difficulties of modern governance and the competing demands of neoliberal disruption and conservative parsimony. During my time there, I saw that these pressures are evident in the small towns of Norway. Many of struggles and fears I discussed with people around Norway sounded uncomfortably similar to those I knew first-hand in the Hawkeye State.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I</span><span class="CharOverride-4">n one town in the south of Norway, Agder, I commiserated with teachers about the pressures of school consolidation. Theirs was a small but a proud school, with a rich history and an intimacy between faculty, staff, students, and the community of which I was envious. “According to the numbers…,” is the way every tight-fisted bean counter starts the argument that per- pupil costs are too high, and that’s how it was in Agder, too.  I personally find it galling when we attribute agency to inanimate things like numbers. Numbers never say anything; only people do. If you have been convinced that numbers speak, then it is difficult to engage in the debate; no one has ever won an argument against a number). So: their cozy school is doomed. Shouldn’t policy makers take into account things like per pupil happiness?</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I</span><span class="CharOverride-4">owa is still 56,000 square miles, and still has 99 counties. Yet the abundance of school districts has gone the way of the Prairie Chicken. School districts have come to need more resources; accordingly they have tended to swallow up their neighbors or form marriages of convenience. In the 1985-86 school year there were 437 public school districts, over one thousand fewer than in 1960. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">S</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ince the 1980s the public school enrollment has been flat, but the number of districts has shrunk. The new millennium welcomed 374 school districts; fifteen years later there were 338. I understand that school districts might need to get bigger to survive, but the needs of our children haven’t changed. How does a community respond to the needs of its most precious members when the community itself has become a byzantine jumble of letters, featureless characters spread across the prairie? Where are AR-WE-VA, STARMONT, and BCLUW? The road maps are silent on this subject. Ask Siri.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I</span><span class="CharOverride-4">n north-central Norway I had conversations with people who were alarmed by similar trends. The battles, in this case,   were two. First, there was a change in airport priorities, with one town getting the upgrade and another town having its airport closed. Additionally, medical facilities were facing policies which employed back-biting economic strangulation to force a change. Medical specialties were purposely divided among three communities instead of being housed in an “efficient” single location. The small towns rightly understood that hosting a medical specialty was a statement about their right to exist in a world where efficiency was a new god.</span></p>

Vardø is hard to get to, but it has a remarkably long and important history in a nation full of towns with long and important histories. In some ways Vardø reminded me of so many towns in the Midwest and Great Lake States. Maybe you have heard the slur, “Rustbelt?”</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">V</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ardø stands on the edge of Norway, and on the edge of western civilization. Outposts like this naturally hold perilous positions. In Vardø the weather is merciless, the Russians are next door, and the ups and downs of the fishing industry have left the town a shell of its glory days. Think of Fort Dodge, Iowa in 1979, compared to its reduced state today. </span></p>

Like so many other small communities in Norway, or in Iowa for that matter, Vardø resists. They resist having more of their administrative duties and positions reallocated to central locations.

A colorful and cartoonish scene of sailors on leave wraps a building on the main street, while down another street, English words cover a warehouse. Across the harbor an oversized exhortation hugs a factory. On viewing it, I assumed it was pedestrian until a double take revealed it was indulging in blasphemy. Or was it playfulness? I guess I was supposed to wonder.</span></p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many of our readers, on learning that someone is a farmer, might automatically assume that person is conservative. Chris Gaunt turns this notion on its head. She is both an Iowa farmer and a dedicated activist for social justice. For this issue of <span class="CharOverride-41">Rootstalk,</span> editor Tapiwa Zvidzwa interviewed her to trace the arc of her career as an activist. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">Rootstalk</span><span class="CharOverride-21">:</span> How did you initially became an activist?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">Gaunt: </span>I didn’t do much of anything until after 9/11/01. I watched and paid attention for the next year and it really tore me up to see my country make a choice to seek revenge through the military. That is, to bomb another country. I was already aware of the sanctions against the Iraqi people at that point, and I had been resisting that, like kind of from a distance.  After 9/11, after witnessing this wave of fear that ran across the United States and literally took over government decisions, I braced my feet and said: “Not me.” I didn’t know what that would mean, but it ended up meaning I would be joining the resistance movement. I first joined in with some people in the Catholic Worker [community] in Des Moines. Then I started getting [involved in] more things nationwide, and that ended up taking me to Washington D.C., where I met friends from all over the country. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">Rootstalk</span><span class="CharOverride-21">:</span> I’d like to focus a bit more on the most recent protest you attended, at the Dakota Access pipeline. What prompted you to join this particular fight, and how did it fit in with the other protests that you’ve gone to?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">Gaunt: </span>Well it’s really interesting because from 2002<span class="CharOverride-4">—</span>a year after 9/11<span class="CharOverride-4">—</span>to 2012, I was involved in just about every protest movement, every nonviolent effort to change government policy concerning torture, that I could get myself in. Sometimes I couldn’t get myself into any protests, because the price I had paid [for previous activism]was going to jail for a number of months at a time, but I just kept [up with that involvement]. I was dedicated to it when I braced my feet, like I told you about a while ago: it [meant I]was dedicating my life to nonviolence, whatever that meant. I think I’ve learned that participating nonviolently [means] putting love into action. That’s where my stand was and is. I had decided I would risk arrest, which I did many times, and I would have to accept the consequences that might have come from [that choice]. That’s part of how I was seeing a nonviolent movement. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;When 2012 got here, there was a switch in me. I can’t really explain it, but I backed off from really participating in the arrest scenarios. I just kind of quit without a lot of understanding, and I’m still trying to understand that. But the mood for me as I’m seeing it now has become more spiritual. Now, I’m tied into several movements across the country that are based in nonviolence, but yet I backed off. So from 2012 until last fall November, I really didn’t [become as involved in] arrestable scenarios<span class="CharOverride-4">—</span>maybe two, during that time. I really had gone to a different place spiritually. I don’t know if that’s a good way to explain it. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;But then the Standing Rock effort came up. Protecting the oil or water and this pipeline it’s just<span class="CharOverride-4">—</span>I mean it’s just this grossest thing<span class="CharOverride-4">—</span>so part of my spiritual development meant me reconnecting with Mother Earth. I did Vision Quest in California in 2010 and in 2012, and that was part of how I got reinforced for  continuing this work. I just got reconnected with Mother Earth, and that took some time. So when this protest came up after [I had taken this ]little sabbatical, it was definitely the one for me because it was the Native Americans as I was seeing it; their water is life, and that’s something to stand for, for everybody. It’s not really an <span class="CharOverride-41">against</span> thing. I recognized that my efforts before I stopped in 2012 [had been]based in my personal sense of anger at my government policies. Now that I had gone through this spiritual thing, the Standing Rock [protest] was perfect for me, because it was a prayerful movement. That’s how it seemed to me, and then I got the chance to go to Standing Rock and experience it, like <span class="CharOverride-41">really</span> experience it in my body. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;So now it doesn’t come from a place of anger  [for me] anymore. The actions I take in the future are going to come from a place of love. That’s a huge hurdle. And I guess to say that I processed that through in four or five years is probably ok and it doesn’t matter how long it takes. So that’s what attracted me to Standing Rock: a prayerful approach to this serious issue. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">Rootstalk</span><span class="CharOverride-21">:</span> Can you describe what the atmosphere was like when you were at some of these protests? </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">G</span><span class="CharOverride-21">aunt: </span>Well, for me it’s you know it ends up being [about connecting] with a lot of like-minded people. If people have gotten together on an issue, and are willing to take that extra step of crossing a line, of being willing to risk arrest, that for me is very life-giving. [Because of] the spiritual changes in me, it’s now coming from a different place. So I think that’s a really good thing. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">Rootstalk</span>: What is the atmosphere like when you’re at these protests?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">Gaunt: </span>That’s something that has changed [for me] too, because part of the negative, the part that was drawing my energy down previous to my rejoining efforts to Standing Rock, was the court procedures. We were getting arrested, and in a lot of [these protests I was] by myself, and a lot of them were in Washington D.C. But I ended up learning. I got so many trespassing charges. They were always nonviolent offenses; criminal misdemeanors. But I got so many charges and I kept getting in front of judges and I thought, <span class="CharOverride-41">OK; this is like speaking truth to power</span>. But the judges kept sentencing me and these friends of mine who were passionate, good people<span class="CharOverride-4">—</span>sentencing us to really irrational prison sentences. I was served a three-month sentence and a six-month sentence. I witnessed my friends go to trial and get sentenced for six months for nonviolently resisting armed drone attacks. We knew in Afghanistan, at the Pakistan border, they were killing, our drones were attacking like young boys like they were [stacking] firewood. And we knew the bombs were dropped on wedding parties and then maybe even a second bomb would be dropped when rescuers came to get in. I’ve been to Afghanistan; we were hearing these stories from the ground. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">Rootstalk</span><span class="CharOverride-21">: </span>And the atmosphere...</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">Gaunt:</span> I’m still kind of putting this together in my own head. I had always thought that nonviolent effort and going to the court [and] civil disobedience  would change things. That was the way it was in the past; the laws changed because people have resisted. But I think I hit a point where I saw, where I felt literally with my body, the futility [of trying to do things this way]. My eyes were opened to [the implications of the Supreme Court’s] Citizens United [decision]. Our elected officials were being bought and paid for. The Occupy Movement, which I was a part of, showed me this, and then [I had this sense of] futility sinking in. So actually, right now, I can say I no longer believe that those kinds of efforts can get the change we need, the legislative change. I’m really sad to say that. So then you are in limbo land and trying to figure out something else out, and then Standing Rock comes up and Occupy before that,;Occupy, Black Lives Matter.  [These movements] give me great hope, because they’re going a little bit of a different path, and I think more and more grassroots organizations are joining. So it’s going to come from the people, and that gives me hope</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">Rootstalk</span><span class="CharOverride-21">:</span> That leads in to our next question. Has the recent Executive Order to continue construction of the pipeline maybe dampened your spirits in some way?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">Gaunt:</span> [chuckles] Yes sir, uhmm, yeah [long pause]. So being involved in the movement to shut down the pipeline, we know we are connected to social media, cetera, email. The resistors are still connected. So we’re not just going to throw up our hands and say, <span class="CharOverride-41">Well you know we’re going to do nothing.</span> I mean, you know, this is connected to survival of the planet. So that’s not an option. So yeah; I do have hope, because of the people connection. Will it get worse before it gets better? Can it get any worse? I don’t think so. That last executive order to go ahead and continue that pipeline, yeah it dampened things. But on Monday (April 24) through Saturday (April 29) there’s a march from Cedar Rapids Iowa all the way to Des Moines, for a big rally that’s to stop the pipeline, and a whole different set of groups are going to participate. We’ll be walking like six, eight miles a day, and [the route runs right by Grinnell], so I’ve already got it all planned. We are already signed up to participate in that march. So I’m going to walk all day on the road together with people, and I’m going to camp with them at night. Different groups are going to meet. We are going to meet with small communities [along the way]. So I’m going to walk with those people and that gives me great hope, because we’re going to bring ourselves together we’re going to listen to people in rural Iowa and take the message to Des Moines, the capital, that this is important to so many people. There’s no giving up hope. With the kind of people that I know  who are in this movement and all, what is happening is that people are joining forces with the different movements around these really important issues. So even as the Executive Order says this is going to go through anyway, the resistance is staying, its going to be there. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">Rootstalk</span><span class="CharOverride-21">: </span>What advice would you have for other people who want to voice their opinions, but who may be scared to go out and do so?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">Gaunt:</span> You know what I saw here [in Grinnell] on March 1st?  The student day of resistance. I saw the most beautiful thing I’ve seen in a long time because Grinnell College students worked their tails off. They worked right here with the local population, and they created a day of protest and education and art music.  So they created a day and a way to make people putting their voices out there safe; they did that.  I witnessed it. They had organizers, and whoever organized it, they did a great job and it was a lot of work I’m sure. They wanted to march downtown to get themselves in the streets, so they called the Grinnell police and got a police escort. They made sure that everyone was safe going through the streets. They created their own artwork for the rally; there was singing, there was music, and there was a rally where students spoke and other people spoke. [One of the Native Americans involved in the Standing Rock protest] spoke about [that] issue, and so it  was a nice conglomeration but they made it safe and I think effective. So I would say: Involve people who you know might not [know, and encourage them to]just say what they have to say or, you know, publicly speak it That’s a great way to start. We’re going to need everybody [if we want to make change]. If change is going to come, it&apos;s going to come from the bottom up. </p>

The rise of an extensive transcontinental railroad network was central to these changes. Industrial cities boomed, with millions leaving their rural and small-town homes to work in urban factories alongside newly arrived immigrants. Electricity enabled many life-changing technologies, such as the telephone, incandescent lighting, and refrigeration. And there was large-scale tapping of petroleum coupled with the invention of the internal combustion engine and the mass production of the automobile—nothing else has changed the U.S. and the American way of life so greatly and rapidly.</span></p>

I have been interested for some time in these responses and have been drawn to explore the life and sensibilities of one particular individual, Ralph Lorenzo Warner (1875-1941).  Warner’s response to the disconcerting agitation and upheaval of American life during his first several decades led him, in his mid-thirties, to create a little “land of long ago,” as he sometimes called it, in which to live and provide a respite for others.</span></p>

Warner created his little land of long ago in the unincorporated village of Cooksville, near Madison, Wisconsin. His house remains a private residence while many of his home furnishings and personal memorabilia have become part of the Cooksville Archives and Collections. I became fascinated with Warner as a pioneer in historic preservation, and as the first in a several-generation lineage of preservation-minded gay men who made their homes in Cooksville in the twentieth century.</span></p>

His main concession to modernity was having a kitchen stove that burned kerosene rather than wood.</span></p>

Starting in 1912 and continuing until he suffered a disabling stroke in 1932, Warner hosted thousands of paying guests, one party at a time and by reservation only, from spring through fall. They came for luncheon or tea or dinner, to see the house and the antiques with which it was furnished, to tour the old-fashioned garden, to enjoy conversation with Warner and his piano artistry, and perhaps to join in singing. Old English ballads were a favorite—“Lord Lovel,” “My Man John,” and “The Raggle Taggle Gypsies, O!” Warner would sometimes dress in nineteenth-century frock coat, waistcoat, and top hat. Occasionally he provided bed and breakfast accommodations. Some guests visited numerous times. “It’s strange that the same people keep coming,” Warner told a reporter. “They bring others, of course, but they are always coming back themselves.”</span><span class="CharOverride-36">2</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> </span></p>

Although he depended on the income, he viewed the House Next Door not as a business but as a refuge from modern life. Feature articles in newspapers and magazines helped to publicize the place, which, in summer, was largely hidden behind a tangle of trees, bushes, and vines. Warner did no advertising and erected no signs to help people find the House Next Door. He preferred to have his guests learn of it personally, through word of mouth, and to experience it not as a restaurant or museum but as a gathering place for kindred spirits who felt out of step with the mainstream of modern life, and who found romance and beauty in the things and ways of the olden days.</span></p>

And as his flow of visitors grew through the years, his workload grew heavier. Ten years into operating the House Next Door, Warner asked a reporter not to write about him. “I already have too much to do,” he said. “I like company but not too many. I must be left alone.

It is telling that Warner viewed a house and garden from the 1840s—just seventy to eighty years earlier—as his land of long ago. Writings about the House Next Door from the 1910s and 1920s give us some idea of how very far back in time the 1840s seemed to Warner and his contemporaries, how completely American life was felt to have changed during the intervening seven or eight decades.

With most needed goods and services produced locally, they did not often have to venture far—occasionally to the larger market towns of Columbus and Watertown, ten to fifteen miles away. A trip to Milwaukee, the nearest large city, required a long day of travel by horse-drawn carriage each way. It was a pattern of human settlement, movement, and commerce that had shaped their ancestors’ lives for centuries, with relatively small and gradual changes through time. Then the railroads came, revolutionizing land transport and thus transforming the human senses of time, distance, and place.</span></p>

Both resided a few blocks from the railway’s depot in the Milwaukee’s Walker’s Point neighborhood.

But along with the noise, pollution, and congestion of his Milwaukee neighborhood, the city offered Warner key advantages: good public schools and excellent musical instruction. He began taking piano lessons at age seven and demonstrated great talent. After going on to study at Chicago Musical College in 1896 and 1897 he returned to live with his parents, who had moved to the Racine area.

Warner lived with his parents in Delavan and then in Walworth, a smaller city nearby. After living for many years amidst the unquiet of industrial cities, it was in tranquil little Walworth that Warner’s mother died in 1908, when she was 58.

In early 1909 he suffered a serious “attack of blood poisoning.” In the fall of that year he left Wisconsin for Forest Grove, Oregon, an 1840s-settled college town near Portland where, the Racine newspaper reported, “he will make his future home.” This venture to the West did not last long.

Noise, overcrowding, air pollution, poor sanitation, and infectious diseases took a great toll. By the first decade of the 1900s, urban campaigns for public health had developed into integrated, citywide programs in many places, including Racine. In 1910 the North Side Boys’ Club joined with several other Racine social welfare organizations—Associated Charities, the Day Nursery, and the Big Sister movement—to form the Central Association, which received financial support from individuals and employers.

Warner was just one of numerous Racine residents that Susan Porter introduced to Cooksville, but Warner’s visit in the spring of 1911 had special significance for both him and the village. Enchanted by the place, he learned that the brick house just south of Miss Porter’s was for sale, for five hundred dollars, and decided to make it his own. The seemingly whimsical name he gave it, the House Next Door, was actually born of his strong connection- and continuity-mindedness.

For several years in Racine his desire to serve others also earned him a modest living as a teacher and friend of needy boys. And then he discovered a new way in which he could serve, one that would enable him to escape the industrial city: creating his little land of long ago, where he would find his own fulfillment while ministering to those scattered souls who were similarly dismayed by the character of modern life and who shared his love for the things and ways of the olden days.</span></p>

A widespread nervous syndrome, known popularly as neurasthenia, was said to be the result of “overwork, crowdedness, ennui, and other tensions associated with metropolitan living.” The New York Health Commissioner stated in 1895 that “in no nation at any time have the demands on the nervous forces been as great as in these United States.”</span><span class="CharOverride-36">18</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> </span></p>

But Warner was an artist, not a journalist, and creating the House Next Door was as central to his response as writing about fictional farm life was to Baker’s. It was Warner’s simple-living retreat from the hazards and hard edges of life in an industrial city, his quiet but eloquent rejection of the American go-ahead-and-don’t-look-back mentality. It was his aesthetically pleasing land of long ago, enabling him to create a home and engage in daily village life in ways that linked him to his grandparents and their rural lives in the early to middle 1800s, back before everything changed.</span></p>

In lavishing his affection and creative artistry on the place, he created a haven not only for himself and his beloved flowers and birds, but also for many others who might have never imagined any alternative to the dictates of American consumer culture</span>.</p>

It is not my home, nor any of my relative’s, but it is the Iowa farm where I have attended summer camp—Country Camp—every year since I was seven.

Throughout my involvement in the food community at Grinnell I began to wonder why women outnumbered men in the alternative agricultural movement despite the fact that agriculture on the whole is traditionally dominated by men. Furthermore, I wondered why these women remain marginalized within agricultural discussions. So began my academic inquiry into a group often forgotten: women farmers.  </span></p>

Through their motivations to farm, these women reconfigure the link between farming and nurturing; through their identities, they claim the title of farmer and imbue it with new meaning; and, through their desire to share their local, farmer-generated, and partial knowledge, these women establish themselves as contributing consciously to a new system of agriculture. Within this system the title “farmer” has been redefined as identifying a person who is concerned with environmental—as well as economic—sustainability, and within which all genders are included. </span></p>

The First Paradigm of Agriculture began with the settlement of Iowa roughly during the 1840s and continued into the 1860s, when the railroad arrived (Bogue 1994). It is defined as the time when Iowa farmers engaged almost entirely in subsistence farming. This is to say that most agricultural products were produced by the family and for the family, rather than being sold to others. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">O</span><span class="CharOverride-4">nce railroads crossed Iowa, agriculture began to change, ushering in the Second Paradigm. This phase lasted from the 1860s through World War Two and is characterized by an increasing focus on the sale of agricultural products to local, regional, and even national markets (Nordin and Scott, 2005; Bogue 1994). On a traditional farm during either the First or Second Paradigm, a heterosexual married couple farmed together and both the man and the woman would have been responsible for equal amounts of labor. However, despite this apparent equality, a patriarchal power hierarchy prevailed and work was divided by gender. Men were likely engaged in more fieldwork and women likely maintained a garden, kept house, and prepared and preserved food. </span></p>

What mainly set this period apart was the introduction of synthetic chemicals—specifically pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. Many of these were developed for the war effort, but were now modified and repurposed for agricultural use (Nordin and Scott 2005; Anderson 2009). During this period, farming also became more mechanized, and gasoline and electricity were increasingly used as energy sources on farms. In addition to the sharp turn into use of synthetic chemicals and machinery, the Third Paradigm is characterized by its prioritization of production and its emphasis on maximizing profit. It is large scale, chemical intensive, and male-dominated. It produces commodity crops and sells them through middlemen as opposed to bringing them to markets where consumers purchase them directly. Today, the Third Paradigm is also called </span><span class="CharOverride-5">conventional agriculture</span><span class="CharOverride-4">.</span></p>

However, beyond these methodological, I define the Fourth Paradigm in terms of motivation, identity, and knowledge sharing. Thus, the Fourth Paradigm is a system in which all farmers, regardless of gender, are motivated to farm as a way in which to nurture others, nurture the self, and nurture a sustainable agricultural system.  The farmer’s identity within the Fourth Paradigm necessitates being both a community builder and a businessperson. Finally, Fourth Paradigm farmers share knowledge with the intention of improving not only the lives of individuals and communities, but also the system of food production itself. Based upon this definition, the women whom I interviewed would likely feel as if they are already a part of a new paradigm. However, as long as the new paradigm is simply an “alternative” to the mainstream, conventional agriculture system, it has not yet realized its full potential. </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-43">Motivation: nourishing versus nurturing </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I</span><span class="CharOverride-4">n all systems of agriculture, farmers—Fourth Paradigm farmers included—want to nourish the world by feeding people. For example, Shannon</span><span class="CharOverride-44">*</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> said, “Good clean healthy food is an inherent right that all people have and many people don’t have access to…the most basic service I can provide to people and the community I care about is to grow good food.” Alice went so far as to say, “In my mind, farming is the most noble thing that a person could possibly do. What’s more important than raising the food for people to eat?” However, alternative farmers are motivated to do more; they also wish to nurture others and themselves, as well as to promote the ideals of the alternative agricultural community. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I</span><span class="CharOverride-4">n light of these ideals, Fourth Paradigm farmers nurture individuals and communities by fostering both reciprocal and educational relationships. The women whom I interviewed feel compelled to act as role models and teachers for customers, employees, and other farmers. Lena said, “My CSA customers need to learn a lot of stuff about food and the environment, and so I take my job of teaching them very seriously. And I also think it’s my job to teach young farmers because I am one of the old timers and I lived to tell about it.” Lena demonstrates the alternative farmers’ impulse to nurture the minds of individuals by sharing knowledge and experiences about food production. Additionally, the Fourth Paradigm is inspired by personal relationships built with others. This paradigm is more conducive to these types of relationships because Fourth Paradigm farmers market their goods directly to customers, thus creating more opportunities for contact between famer and consumer. This is exemplified by Shannon’s love for the stories her customers regularly share with her at the Farmers Market regarding recipes and preparation of the foods she grows. She said that she is motivated to farm because of “the stories and relationships that define us and our relationship to food.” </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">F</span><span class="CharOverride-4">inally, these women demonstrated that a need for independence motivated their decision to become farmers. They talked about a deep appreciation for being in control of their own day to day activities.  Alice said, “My favorite part about farming is when I have plenty of time and I can be outdoors directing myself in whatever I want to do, and I can completely lose myself in my work.” These women also discussed their love for working outside on the farm, as opposed to being in an office. Jane said, “The best part [of farming] is being outside almost all the time for so much of the year and just feeling really in the world. Not having to look through a window.” These women reject the bureaucratic constraints of the corporate world through their decision to farm and instead find a sense of freedom in their self-determined daily schedules. A cross-cultural study by Carolyn Sachs (1983) supports this idea: “it is clear that the women who are independent producers have more control over their labor and the farm operation” (108). By choosing to farm alternatively on their own operations, as opposed to working within bureaucratic, and often patriarchal, office cultures or even on farms run by men, these women reclaim control over their own labor.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">t first glance, these women’s motivations appear ironic. They seek independence from the patriarchy, yet choose to join the traditionally male-dominated domain of agriculture. They are driven by an intention to nurture others, a concept gendered as feminine in this society. However, closer examination reveals that this paradox exemplifies these women’s innovative brilliance. By choosing to enter farming, these individuals reconstruct the meaning of “farmer.” They are self-reliant women who also maintain the motivation to nurture.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he identity of women farmers in the United States is not static or uniform. Disparity exists between women’s historical identification as “farm helpers” (Sachs 1983: 108) and the identification of the farmers whom I interviewed for this project as “primary farmers.” Golubovic (2011) says, “The basic meaning of identity refers to where one (a person or a group) belongs.” Further, individuals claim multiple identities based upon the different social contexts in which they exist (Stryker 1986 cited in Brasier et al. 2014: 287). An exploration of identity within the current agricultural context reveals that Fourth Paradigm farmers do more than grow food for others. Instead, their “farmer” identity encompasses concepts of community builder and businessperson, and is also inclusive of women in a way that previous paradigms have not been. </span></p>

For example, Alice sees herself as a caretaker of her land: “I think of myself as a steward of the farm. I think that the farm is my legacy, at least I intend for it to be.” Lisa sees herself as a caretaker of her livestock: “I really like to be a caretaker when livestock are birthing. Especially sheep. Lambs. They’re unique… sheep are almost like human beings.” Sandra identifies as a caretaker of many living things, both human and non-human: “…of animals, of children, of grandchildren. Sometimes of volunteers, employees. Yes. All of the above. And plants.” In addition to being caretakers, these women identify as activists, though they could also mean educators. Alice declared that she is an activist because she has a “strong opinion against industrial agriculture. I support local food, local farmers. I support family farms and am against CAFOs and integrators.” Lisa identifies as an activist through her efforts to educate people about her work: “If people are curious about how we are doing things, we invite them to the farm...”</span></p>

However, because they also identify as businesspeople, they push back against stereotypes. Eight of the ten women responded that they identify as businesspeople, and one is working towards identifying in this way. For example, Lena says, “You gotta make money. More is better…Every time I plant something, I say, ‘ok, we’re gonna make a lot of money on this crop.’ We usually don’t. But we make enough.” Here Lena demonstrates how a Fourth Paradigm farmer, no matter their gender, must consider financial gains and losses to maintain viability. She also exemplifies the way in which the Fourth Paradigm accepts that agriculture must function within the existing capitalist system and be able to generate profit, but that it also differentiates itself from the Third Paradigm by understanding profit to be but one criterion of a farm’s success. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">F</span><span class="CharOverride-4">inally, the Fourth Paradigm differentiates itself on the topic of identity through its acceptance of women as farmers and its inclusivity of individuals who identify with the LGBTQ community. This is made evident primarily due to the simple fact that the women whom I interviewed identify as primary farmers and as women. Take Sandra, for example, who said that her identity as a farmer grew out of the sexism she faced as a woman in agriculture:  “I was the fulltime farmer, and I think I started [identifying as a farmer] just out of annoyance, frustration and anger…I took on that identity as a way to fight back and say ‘Ok, you can’t ignore me any longer.’” This impatience was also made evident when the women said they do not wish to farm with a male counterpart because they feel this would inhibit their ability to learn the skills necessary to be farmers in their own right.  Charlotte said, “I’m really glad that I’m doing this on my own actually…I also think that there are so many ways in which it would be easy to accidently defer and not learn how to do things and not ask the questions.”  Further, the only instance in which a woman whom I interviewed identified as a “farmer’s wife” was in the context of Tanya’s female-female relationship in which she felt part of an equal team of farm contributors. In sum, these women balance the economic aspects of their farms alongside the agrarian ideals of community building, while also rejecting the gendered hierarchy that has characterized all types of farming up until now.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-43">Knowledge and knowledge-sharing</span> </p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">hese women farmers conceptualize knowledge as partial and believe it is necessary to participate in knowledge sharing communities in order to enrich themselves, their communities, and the alternative agricultural system. This understanding of knowledge coincides with that of postmodern theory. Sachs (1996) shares that within postmodern theory there is no one single “Truth,” but instead a multiplicity of truths. No one person or institution is capable of possessing all knowledge and thus a knowledge community is necessary through which to share information (19). In the Fourth Paradigm of agriculture, this means that knowledge produced by individual farmers is valued in addition to that produced institutionally. Further, knowledge is not considered to be universally applicable, but instead exists only within the context of a specific place and time. In the words of Donna Haraway (1988), knowledge is understood to be “situated…which is to say that knowledge is generated within, and applicable to, particular circumstances” (590). Put into an agricultural context this means that although a farming method may work for one particular farmer it will not necessarily work for all farmers on all farms. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">L</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ooking to the farmers themselves, Shannon explained that she gains insight on how to improve her own agricultural methods from visiting others’ operations and learning from fellow alternative farmers. She said, “any time I visit someone else’s farm, I’m always picking up little hints of how they do things, and just conversations, sitting with someone else and just talking about all the things.” Shannon seeks to gain knowledge from her peers in order to enrich her capabilities as a farmer. Charlotte described the value of alternative agriculture conferences as space in which farmers share knowledge with each other with hopes of benefiting all members of the farming community. She discussed </span><a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-4">Practical Farmers of Iowa</span></a><span class="CharOverride-4"> (PFI) in particular, saying: “…there are just some really incredible networks for knowledge sharing. PFI is one of them, and I’ve really appreciated the welcome of a lot of PFI farmers to ask questions…” Finally, Kari said that she shares knowledge with some farmers who would be considered her biggest competitors because they all understand that they hold the same core values and all wish to see the system of alternative agriculture flourish. Kari justified this potentially counterintuitive decision, “We have a relationship and a trust level that we know that we’re not going to undercut each other. We know that we care about each other’s best interests. We know that we both care about the same philosophy.” This common philosophy demonstrates that these farmers share knowledge in order to support the system of alternative agriculture as a whole. In sum, these women’s conscious contribution to a new paradigm of agriculture, one that they believe to be more sustainable, by engaging in reciprocal relationships of knowledge sharing defines a fundamental characteristic of the Fourth Paradigm. </span></p>

As the weather starts to warm up, thousands of Iowans gather their wicker baskets and walking sticks and hit their favorite parks and wooded areas. The Midwest is a goldmine for popular edibles like morels, oysters, and boletes, yet this subculture of mushroom enthusiasts is still underground and unfamiliar to most of the public. For some, mushrooms are an acquired taste and the idea of eating anything that was found on a tree stump is gag-inducing. With the right training and recipes, however, mushroom newbies too can enjoy the delight of finding dinner in the dirt. Many of us don’t know how and where to start looking, and expert foragers are not too keen on giving away their secret mushroom spots to inquirers. However, mycological associations bring together the experienced and the amateurs, so that people with no background in mycology have the opportunity to learn the ins-and-outs of Iowa’s mushroom scene from serious mushroom hunters. To gain some insight into this esoteric Midwestern tradition, the president and vice president of the Prairie States Mushroom Club (PSMC), Glen Schwartz and Dave Layton graciously shared their advice from 13 years in PSMC for those of us who want to know what the mushroom craze is all about.</span></p>

			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">SCHWARTZ</span>: I grew up on a dairy farm in north-central Minnesota and we hunted morels every Spring.

			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;in different locations: In Minnesota, they are found at the edge of the swamps, while in Iowa, they are in the upland forest. In September of 2005, I was visiting my sister on her dairy farm just a few miles from where I grew up. My brother-in-law and I picked buckets of fall mushrooms from a nearby woods. We had to throw them all out because we could not identify any of them, despite using several mushroom books. A few months later, my friend Roger asked if I was interested in joining a mushroom club, where he serves as treasurer. I jumped at the opportunity to learn more about mushrooms, especially those that appear in the fall.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">LAYTON</span>: When I was 18 a friend had me try morels and I was hooked. I was also haunted about finding a hillside full of them a couple years earlier with an older friend who just shook his head when I said, “They don’t look edible to me.” I didn’t take any. When I was 19, on a walkabout, I found a nice patch of morels. This time I found a recipe for stuffed morels and cooked them</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"> </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;for my family. For a brief time I was a favored son. I wasn’t so lucky in subsequent morel searches, but one time I found these big floppy mushrooms that were tan on top with white gills growing on wood. I got a mushroom book and soon learned they were also a tasty edible<span class="CharOverride-4">—</span>oyster fungus. I fried them with eggs and breadcrumbs. Every time I found a new mushroom I checked out all the mushroom books from the library. Within a few years I identified dozens of species of mushrooms<span class="CharOverride-4">—</span>many of those very tasty.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">ROOTSTALK</span>: What do you enjoy about mushrooms?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">LAYTON</span>: I enjoy so many things about mushrooms, like the mysteries of their growth and interactions with their habitat or the beauty of their bold shapes against an otherwise drab backdrop. I also enjoy how they turn a walk in the woods into a combination of an Easter egg hunt and a new learning experience. However, what I enjoy most is finding and identifying a new (for me) species. So really what I enjoy most about mushrooms is knowing from experience that somewhere in my future, as long as I keep my eyes open, I’ll find something amazing!</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">SCHWARTZ</span>: The general population knows almost nothing about mushrooms and fungi, and it doesn’t take much knowledge to become an “expert” in the eyes of most. Before I joined the Prairie States Mushroom Club (PSMC), I knew about morels and giant puffballs, and that was it. Once I joined the club and started looking for mushrooms, they were everywhere! I was amazed at the enormous variety of colors, sizes, and shapes of fungi…and I had never noticed them before. It was like looking through corrective glasses for the first time, and being amazed by how much I could see. Within a few years of joining the club, I was able to make actual scientific contributions. Out on a walk in the woods one day, I found a large quantity of two different mushrooms. One had not been positively identified in Iowa since the 1930s, the other had never been recorded west of the Mississippi River. Turns out, the fungi kingdom has a lot yet to be discovered. The experts are constantly reordering the fungi Class, Family, and Genus, and giving mushrooms new species names based on DNA studies. This indicates that there is much left to learn, and amateurs with no formal training, like me, are able to add to the knowledge base.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">ROOTSTALK</span><span class="CharOverride-41">:</span> What attracts people to mushroom hunting and brings people to forays (group gatherings to pick and identify fungi)?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">LAYTON</span>: I could smugly answer that what attracts me to forays is the chance to act like a mushroom know-it-all and scoop up all the edibles left on the identifying table. The truth is that I love seeing so many mushrooms that I wouldn’t have found on my own and I’ve learned more from others at forays than I’ve taught to them. Overall, the same thing brings me to forays as it does the first time novice<span class="CharOverride-4">—</span>the quest for knowledge.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">SCHWARTZ</span>: Most of the people of Iowa know of morel mushrooms, and maybe half have actually eaten them. One of our most popular forays is our annual morel hunt at Wickiup Park. We specifically encourage people to attend that have never found a morel before. And most years, we are able to bring them to a place in the woods with morels. Most of them are thrilled to find their first morel, and I enjoy their excitement almost as much as they do. For most people, that is enough. However, there are many outdoor enthusiasts that have observed other mushrooms while out turkey or deer hunting, or during a hike in the woods. Some are curious about what they have seen and if it is edible. Like me before I joined the club, they assume there are 30 or 40 total species to be found, and that anyone leading a foray will know all mushrooms encountered. Once informed that Iowa probably has 10 to 20 thousand species of fungi, a few are fascinated with the idea of finding out more about the mushrooms they have previously found, and learning from local guides. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">ROOTSTALK</span><span class="CharOverride-41">:</span> How can people get started?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">SCHWARTZ</span>: Joining a local mushroom club like PSMC is really the key to an enjoyable mushroom hobby. You will learn as much in a single outing with the club as you could learn on your own in a year. You don’t really need much gear, just a pocket knife and a basket. To be safe, however, you will also need a compass (or a GPS unit), long pants, waterproof boots, bug spray, hat, and a walking stick. The stick can be found after you enter the woods, or you can purchase one, or even use a ski pole. Most people don’t bother with a stick at first, but once you start using one, you will realize how valuable it can be. A really high percentage of the mushrooms are found in the woods. Generally speaking, the more mature the woods, the more mushroom species can be found. Having said that, there are also a lot of mushrooms to be found in town. One of our club members even considered writing a book on urban mushrooms. Several years ago, I had three species of slime molds and six species of fungi in my yard at the same time (I live in suburban Cedar Rapids on a typical city lot).</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">ROOTSTALK</span><span class="CharOverride-41">:</span> How do people avoid getting poisoned?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">LAYTON</span>: Know exactly what each and every mushroom you pick is. Don’t assume that just because mushrooms are the same general color and in the same location at the same time they are the same. There are no rules of thumb! Don’t eat old, desiccated mushrooms of any kind. Know what they’re like fresh.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">SCHWARTZ</span>: It is easy for me to avoid mushroom poisoning, as I only eat mushrooms I am certain will be edible. Michael Kuo (who runs the website <a href=""><span class="Hyperlink">MushroomExpert.com</span></a> and is an accomplished amateur mycologist) suggests that you positively identify a mushroom at least three times before you eat it. Last year, I found a Bolete that I had never found before. I consulted several books and multiple websites before deciding to eat them. I was, and still am, certain that I had properly identified them, and they were delicious, but they did give me diarrhea. This brings up the point that, just because a mushroom is known to be edible, does not mean that everyone can eat it without any problems.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">ROOTSTALK</span><span class="CharOverride-41">: </span>Are there any mushroom guides you recommend?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">LAYTON</span>: I have at least two dozen mushroom guides. I never use just one to identify a mushroom.  I also use the internet once I get narrowed down to one or two genus.  <a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-41">Mushrooms Demystified </span></a>by David Arora is probably one of the most comprehensive and he has some pretty witty comments.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">SCHWARTZ</span>: I always go to <a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-41">Mushrooms of Northeast North America</span></a> by George Barron first. This book is organized in a unique way that makes it exceptionally easy to use. It is really geared to the beginner, but it is so good that I always start there. The absolute best guide to edible mushrooms is <a href=""><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-41">Edible Wild Mushrooms of Illinois &amp; Surrounding States</span></a> by Joe McFarland and Gregory M. Mueller. My favorite website is the aforementioned <a href=""><span class="Hyperlink">MushroomExpert.com</span></a>.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">ROOTSTALK</span><span class="CharOverride-41">:</span> How are mushrooms best cooked and eaten?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">SCHWARTZ</span>: I am not much of a cook, and I prepare all mushrooms like they were morels...that is, I fry them in some butter and add a little salt. This works for about half of the mushrooms that I have eaten. Unfortunately, I have cooked some “choice” edibles that were not very good because I fried them, and they should have been prepared a different way.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-42">ROOTSTALK</span><span class="CharOverride-41">:</span> How are mushrooms important to Iowa and prairie culture?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">SCHWARTZ</span>: Mushroom hunting in eastern Iowa is extremely popular. In Linn County (Cedar Rapids), I like to say that we have a population of 200,000 and that 150,000 hunt morels. That is a bit of an exaggeration, but when you are two miles from the nearest road and the woods has been stomped flat, you will agree that the number of morel hunters is impressive. In Cedar Rapids, this can be traced back to the large number of Czech immigrants in the 1800s. They brought with them a love of the outdoors and a taste for wild mushrooms. This is still honored today with the Houby Days celebration every May in the Czech Village neighborhood in Cedar Rapids.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-21">LAYTON</span>: We could start with fungi being essential to the existence of all life and try to get more specific from there. Mushrooms signal the health of a habitat. Mushrooms are critical for healthy woodlands where they form a multitude of beneficial relationships with trees and break down dead wood into nutrients for all the forest plants. This is especially important in Iowa where sometimes it seems that trees themselves are endangered. Our remaining parkland is critical to preserve, and mushrooms help to demonstrate the diverse ecology represented in parks and preserves. Corn and beans are great, but we need oak savannas, mixed hardwood valleys and bluffs, trout streams and forest surrounded rivers and lakes if Iowa is going to be a great place to live.  </p>

You’re most likely to see one prowling above a forest edge or field using just a few stiff wingbeats followed by a glide.

Local restaurants contributed beer, wine, and venison stew, as guests of all ages milled in and filled the building. Local duo </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/PinkNeighbor/"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-4">Pink Neighbor</span></a><span class="CharOverride-4">, (Katie In and Erik Jarvis), played before the lounge’s fireplace while people gathered around and finished their drinks. Pink Neighbor’s themes of rambling and seeking were a good setup for The Pines. The songs were playful, with an upbeat Indie-Americana vibe. In and Jarvis took a turn at keyboard, guitar, and lead vocals, but it was In’s clear singing that was most memorable. After this opener, smiling ticket holders were ushered to the fourth floor, and into the black box theater of the Loft, where three chairs and instruments awaited The Pines.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">D</span><span class="CharOverride-4">avid Huckfelt and Benson Ramsey started The Pines in 2002, and have since honed their sound—a moody and acoustic alt-country blend, mixed with Midwestern folk lyricism. Joined by bandmate Alex Ramsey, Benson Ramsey’s brother (the Ramsey brothers have ties to Iowa folk music royalty, as they are the sons of guitarist Bo Ramsey, who is husband of Pieta Brown, Greg Brown’s daughter), on keyboards, the trio took the stage, sat down, and played without a word of greeting. The band opened with the wonderfully evocative “Hanging from the Earth,” and the audience was immediately spellbound. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">R</span><span class="CharOverride-4">amsey and Huckfelt alternated lead vocals throughout the set, but they were smart to have Ramsey start off with this first song, as it had an aching, emotional quality that lasted throughout the evening. The Loft hummed with atmospheric chords, the pair’s guitars, and Ramsey’s emotive voice. The band seemed to have cracked open a kind of communal landscape of memory in the intimate room; a shared sense of loss, edged with hope. Fight or flight, oh I’m flying over the fields, Ramsey sang, and if I say I’m alright, then I’m lyin’ / Am I dreamin’ or is this real / Am I dreamin’ or is this real / Skeletons of buffalo, roam the great plains / And the rooster on the arrow is bleeding in the rain” </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he band members are native Iowans, now living in Minneapolis and contributing to the Twin Cities’ acoustic sound with their signature ambient chords and loops. Their move was the reverse of mine, coming from my native Minneapolis to make a home in Iowa only a few years ago. And perhaps that’s why I felt such an instant sense of recognition in their music and lyrical imagery. My feeling of familiarity and commonality seemed to be one that the entire audience shared. Was everyone adrift in thoughts of lost times, as I was? Throughout the concert I found myself thinking of my father, a lifelong railroad man who had passed away less than a year ago. I also thought of the times I’ve spent alone on the road. I thought I could hear similarities to some of my other favorite road musicians—J.J. Cale, Lucinda Williams, Bob Dylan, and Townes Van Zandt. But if those musicians have laid claim to their parts of the country, The Pines own the Midwestern freeways that traverse the farms and grasslands. In fact, the first time I heard The Pines, it was on the car radio while I drove alone on I-80, just after twilight, headed east, cutting past acres and acres of farmland that, itself, had once cut through prairie. It was a perfect backdrop for their music. It seems that The Pines have tapped into the viewpoint that prairies exist, now, more often in memory or imagination than as a feature of the landscape. What we try to recapture in prairie restoration is something the band aims to recapture in song.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he three musicians, who remained seated through the concert, slowly loosened into enjoyable conversation with the audience. They wore stocking hats and brown sweaters, each in a different style; and each guy wore a chain around his neck, on which hung metallic pieces I couldn’t identify, but which reminded me of my dad’s old railroad switch keys. We work hard, the band seemed to be telling us. We are of the land, we aren’t better than you. We’re not here to put on a show, just to share our music.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">t times the concert was haunting—straight up Midwestern Gothic—rife with musical nods to dead towns, pioneer ghosts, and collapsed barns. Songs like “Sleepy Hollow,” brought all three voices together, briefly, on the chorus, and the effect was like hearing the howl of wind through the fields, or the birdcall of a distant train whistle. We in the audience knew such sounds, because we live in these open spaces, these “flyover” states. What The Pines brought to us in Above the Prairie was, in part, access to the peculiar anxiety of life on the prairie: What can we make of the land here? How can we prosper, how can we sustain what’s good? And also, What can never be ours? What are we missing out on? </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">t other times, the group’s sound was grounded, modestly proud, and even optimistic. And this was the tone that the concert favored overall—leaving out songs like “Villisca” (an instrumental about the small Iowa town known for its 1912 axe murders), but soaring on songs like “Where Something Wild Still Grows.” Their closing song, “Aerial Ocean,” was what Ramsey laughingly referred to their “one happy song.” In it, he cried out, hold on / hold on to me, and I felt it as a prayer to the Earth. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">W</span><span class="CharOverride-4">hen their set was finished, the crowd called them back out for an encore. By that time, the mood in the theater was pure camaraderie. When asked whether the audience had any questions, someone up front said, “How do you feel connected to the prairie?” There was a long pause, and laughter, as Huckfelt wasn’t sure how to answer. But the band’s connection was apparent and organic, one expressed better in music than talk. “It’s so rare,” Huckfelt observed, “to have so many prairie lovers in one room!”</span></p>

We in the Midwest are proud of our section of the biome – the tallgrass prairie, which spreads from Manitoba south through the center of the continent to the Texas Gulf Coast, and reaches from Iowa eastward to Ohio and southern Ontario (Fig. 1). Like all biomes across the world, and other grasslands, the prairie was a product of climate, soils and the organisms that thrived in its environment. Most grasslands share several underlying environmental factors. Foremost is a climate that delivers 10-40 inches of annual precipitation, and which varies seasonally in a way that supports high primary productivity on one hand, and its subsequent senescence and accumulation as litter on the other. Here also, summer heat and thunderstorms combined with low humidity and warm winds to promote lightning-caused fires, an essential factor in making the tallgrass prairie. Ice storms and tornadoes helped thin tree canopies, and the presence of such browsers as buffalo, elk, and deer suppressed woody shrubs along grassland-woodland edges.</span></p>

This points to a very long-term trend in climate, with gradual cooling during the entire Precambrian. There are signs the cooling trend was punctuated by periods of deep cooling that caused glaciation, some which may have covered most of the Earth (Zalasiewicz and Williams 2012).   </span></p>

Continental drift also played an important role in these changes, relocating the Midwest from the equatorial topics to its current temperate location with a continental climate. The tropical-like vegetation of the Late Carboniferous Period (318-299 million years ago)—the source of Iowa’s coal deposits—was forever lost, its presence now confirmed by fossils of Lepidodendron and Calamites (large tree-like plants that are now extinct).                                       </span></p>

This spike in global temperature, lasting about 150,000 years, is called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) (Zalasiewicz and Williams 2012, Scott and Lindsey 2014, Hansen and Sato 2012). During the Mesozoic greenhouse, global surface temperature is estimated to have been around 25°C (77°F) on average.   During the PETM, global surface temperature may have risen to 28°C (82.5°F). Considering that the current global surface temperature is approximately 14.5°C (58°F), the temperatures during the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic represent an Earth that was 24°F warmer than what we experience now.   Tropical to subtropical environments, with palm trees and crocodiles, existed above the Arctic Circle (Scott and Lindsey 2014), with 74°F summer water temperature at the North Pole. Such temperatures, combined with a rain shadow that limited precipitation in the Great Plains and Midwest, surely increased aridity in the region, and fostered an environment very conducive to grassland formation. </span></p>

We know that the Midwest, from the middle Miocene to late Pliocene, was warmer than at present, and that it supported a grassland ecosystem. Direct evidence of the plant life also confirms that this grassland was a precursor to our present-day tallgrass prairie. Phytoliths are microscopic silica bodies that precipitate in and around cells in many plants. When plant tissues decompose, the silica is deposited in the soil, forming a record of past vegetation. An analysis of phytoliths from Nebraska and Kansas indicates that habitats varied substantially in openness during the middle to late Miocene, but became more uniformly open, corresponding to relatively open grassland or savanna, during the late Miocene and early Pliocene. There was also an increase of phytoliths characteristic of C4 grasses between 8 and 5 million YBP, which indicates the proportion of C4 grasses reached up to 50-60 percent of the grasses (Strömberg and McInerney 2011).

Figure 6 provides a pollen diagram for a site in Illinois, on the eastern edge of the tallgrass prairie, which covers 14,000 years of vegetation (King 1981). Spruce parkland (grass pollen indicates some openness in the structure) was dominant 14,000 years ago, and was replaced a 1,000 years later with an ash-elm community that was more closed. The ash-elm ecosystem persisted until about 9,000 years ago, when oak-dominated woodland or savanna become more prominent. The coverage of oak woodland/savanna increased as the spruce parkland faded away, and was well represented on the landscape through recent time (at 1,000 years ago, the end of the time frame). It appears to have contracted somewhat between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago, coinciding with a rise in prairie.   By 1,000 years ago, the oak woodland/savanna was dominant again, but this time a rise in the presence of weedy species (such as goosefoot, a species that colonizes disturbed ground) suggests that human disturbance was a more frequent factor (King 1981).</span></p>

Ecological succession is an ecosystem process that is central to the study of plant communities. It is a change in vegetation type over time due to an extended and consistent change in environment. Plant migration is the expansion of a plant species occurrence in space, caused by the movement of seeds and resulting in a change in the species range. Migration, for any organism, spans generations, so it encompasses both time and space. The series of plant communities present in the central Great Plains and Midwest from 32,000 to 2,000 years ago (Fig. 10) is the result of plants responding to environmental change. The warming climate was a primary factor in the environmental change, but other factors were likely important too—for example changes in the soil and disturbance caused by glaciation and the eventual deposition of glacial drift when the ice melted.  Palynological studies have clearly shown that plant migration, induced by climate change, is a principal factor in understanding the prairie’s native plant communities.</span></p>

The “war” between grassland and forest (in terms of which ecosystem occupied the landscape), which played out along the edge between these two biomes, was won by grassland for 3,000 to 4,000 years. Plant migration of tallgrass prairie species pushed prairie eastward from what was then the heart of the prairie, into Indiana, Ohio and parts of Michigan and Pennsylvania, in what is referred to as the prairie peninsula (Fig. 8). At the same time the tallgrass prairie was expanding eastward, species from the mid-grass prairie in the Great Plains (the western and drier version of the central grassland biome) were also migrating in that direction, advancing into central Iowa. Pollen studies covering North America’s last 18,000 years suggest that the peninsula began 8,000 years ago. Eventually, as the Holocene climate cooled and the Midwestern environment become more cool and moist and the wild fires waned, the forest began to win the war with grassland. Forest encroachment reclaimed landscapes that had been lost during the HCO. Plant migration shifted the forest, tallgrass prairie, and mid-grass prairie back to the west, making a landscape more similar to the present.</span></p>

Fluctuating sea levels caused by fluctuating climate were integral to the formation of Midwestern bedrock layers (through formation of sedimentary rock in marine or coastal environments) and its effects on ecosystem soils and topography. Grassland expansion was favored by the climate which mountain-building brought about, and the climate during greenhouse conditions pushed plant evolution in the direction of C4 photosynthesis, an important characteristic of prairie grasses. Icehouse environments, with their pattern of alternating glaciation and interglacial periods, were responsible for much of the Midwest’s soil and topography. However, in the end, the most significant factors in this process of landscape creation are the most recent ones. Plants responded to climate change by migrating, and during the retreat and advance of glaciers over the last one million years, this has had dramatic effects on our tallgrass prairie.   </span></p>

Then a long sequence of glacial episodes occurred, during which both plant and animal species moved first southward to locations of refugia during glaciation and then most likely spread back northward during interglacial periods. The southward migrations would have occurred through secondary succession (succession on sites that after disturbance still retain soil, seeds, roots, and organisms), as colder weather removed sensitive species and created space for southward-moving species. Northward migrations would have incorporated primary succession (succession of sites disturbed so severely all biological legacy is removed), as melting glaciers exposed new geological deposits and landscapes. </span></p>

It involves four processes:   reproduction (seed production), dispersal of offspring, establishment (seed germination and seedling survival) and growth to reproductive maturity (to produce more offspring). Dispersal occurs via transport of seeds, spores or fruits. Anemochory (wind dispersal), endozoochory (inside of animals) and ectozoochory (on outside of animals) are the principal mechanisms plants use for dispersal. Because migration over long distances is a generational process, short-lived plants (annuals or biennials) can migrate faster than long-lived plants (perennials). The life history strategy of species, which describes its allocation of energy to survival, growth and reproduction, is central to how quickly a species migrates.   Migration happens at the levels of individuals and of populations; communities do not migrate as units.  Each species’ unique life history and niche affects its ability to establish and grow, and give it a unique migration behavior. As in a gigantic mixing bowl, where the ingredients are independently added and subtracted at different rates and from different parts of the kitchen, the mix of the region’s vegetation was produced by the complex interaction of species-specific migration behavior, different regional refugial locations (places species migrated to during ice advances to survive), and the long sequence of many glacial episodes in the north central U.S. </span></p>

Madagascar, an isolated tropical island off the coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean, has one of the highest endemic rates—80 percent of its plant and animal species are endemic (found nowhere else on earth). Nearly all of the plant species that inhabit the tallgrass prairie also occur in other ecosystems in other parts of the country.

Most of the tallgrass prairie species in Iowa are geographically-restricted within Iowa; they are not distributed state-wide. This has very important implications in prairie reconstruction and the design of seed mixes. To ensure that reconstructed prairies function and look like remnant prairies, the species that are seeded should be native to that region of Iowa. A sense of place is imperative; simply being native to Iowa does not insure a sufficient level of accuracy in recreating a prairie. It’s the geographically-restricted species that furnish a prairie with its unique signature, a locally-determined factor that distinguishes it from other prairies in the state and expresses an area’s home-grown natural heritage. Since the biogeographical ranges of organisms do not recognize political boundaries, every state has geographically-restricted species.</span></p>

The difference has provided greater protection from woody encroachment in the north, where larger tracts of higher quality prairie are present.</span></p>

The eastward shift of mid-grass prairie from the Great Plains into Iowa explains the occurrence of many western species in Iowa, especially in the Loess Hills. For example, dotted blazing star (</span><span class="Letter-H_LeadPageTitles CharOverride-55">Liatris punctata</span><span class="Letter-H_LeadPageTitles CharOverride-23">) and scarlet guara (</span><span class="Letter-H_LeadPageTitles CharOverride-55">Gaura coccinea</span><span class="Letter-H_LeadPageTitles CharOverride-23">) only occur in the Loess Hills and on dry microenvironments at a few other sites, also in the western third of state. These species probably arrived in Iowa during the Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO) and spread throughout most of Iowa at that time. However, when cooler, damper environments returned, most populations died out except for those located in microenvironments (southwest slopes in the Loess Hills, dry gravelly soil on glacial moraines) that mimic the arid habitats in the Great Plains.  Large-flower beard tongue (</span><span class="Letter-H_LeadPageTitles CharOverride-55">Penstemon grandiflorus</span><span class="Letter-H_LeadPageTitles CharOverride-23">), a species centered in the central Great Plains, also occurs in the Loess Hills and many other gravelly or sandy sites into eastern Iowa. It can also be found in disjunct populations on the sand dune ecosystems at the south end of Lake Michigan in Indiana. Its current biogeography, with outlier populations in Ohio and Michigan, seems to follow the prairie peninsula.</span></p>

Perhaps the most important outcome of the HCO and the expansion of the prairie peninsula is that prairie was firmly established in Iowa at a time (5,000 years ago) that is recent on a geological timescale. Mid-grass and tallgrass prairie likely covered all of Iowa by the end of the HCO, a period when it was very difficult to be a tree in Iowa. So even though climate in the Midwest has been favoring forest for the last 3,000 years or so, the prairie was so deeply entrenched in Iowa, its resilience and stability has enabled it to resist forest encroachment. This greatly helped to insure Iowa’s legacy as the heart of the tallgrass prairie, and it has furnished us with a rich array of prairie communities to appreciate, study, honor and protect.   </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap"><span class="Letter-H_LeadPageTitles CharOverride-23">L</span></span><span class="Letter-H_LeadPageTitles CharOverride-23">ooking back into history and examining the patterns of global climate change on Earth has helped to address questions concerning function, process and pattern on our present-day ecosystems and landscapes. So what does the climate data suggest to us concerning the future? Out of the large body of scientific research on Earth’s past climates—some of which has been cited in this paper—two important philosophies emerge. First, natural climate change, with magnitudes much greater than humans have experienced, has been a consistent pattern in Earth’s history. During those changes, there must have been massive shuffling, mixing, crowding and killing of the Earth’s biodiversity during glacial advances. But each time, during periods of glacial retreat or greenhouses, life rebounded, and evolution likely produced species more adept at coping with the Earth’s fickle climate. Second, the time frame for these oscillations in climate—during which the amount of change was astounding—ranged from 50,000 to more than 10,000,000 years. Patterns in the Earth’s orbit around the sun and plate tectonics are the principal forces that drive long-term climate (Zachos et al. 2001). These are forces that proceed over incredibly long time scales; far beyond any individual’s concept of time. Current climate is changing at a much quicker rate. Global temperature, in just the last 100 years, has completely reversed a downward temperature trend that occurred over the last 7,000 years.  It’s simply not possible for the climate change currently underway to be explained by the Earth’s natural cycles. We ought to be in a downward temperature trend—the pattern expected at the end of an interglacial. Instead, global temperature is increasing at rate faster than ever experienced. So the outlook for the future is somewhat disconcerting and ambiguous, except that temperature is likely to continue to increase and that time and evolution are probably not on our side. It is in its way, a grand experiment. What happens when vast amounts of carbon from Earth’s vast, long-term, carbon storage pools are released to the atmosphere? I usually like experimental study and exploring science to satisfy my curiosity. But this is one experiment most of us wish could be stopped.</span></p>
