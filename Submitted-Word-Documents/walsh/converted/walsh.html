<p><em>“Let a man decide upon his favorite animal and make a study of it…let him learn to understand its sounds and motions. The animals want to communicate with man, but Wakan-Tanka does not intend they shall do so directly – man must do the greater part in securing an understanding.” </em> – Brave Buffalo of Standing Rock Reservation (Lakota)<sup><a href="#endnote-1" id="endnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Recently, I learned about the Oglala Lakota tribe’s history and relationship with bison, the largest land mammal in North America. In the mid-sixteenth century, the North American prairie was home to an estimated 40 million bison and tens of thousands of Lakota people. By the mid-nineteenth century, the bison had all but been eradicated and the Lakota population reduced forced into reservations. For the Oglala Lakota, bison are incredibly meaningful culturally and spiritually<sup><a href="#endnote-2" id="endnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup>. To them, the bison are one with the earth and represent all growing and living beings<sup><a href="#endnote-3" id="endnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup>. In myth, the “White Buffalo Cow Woman<sup><a href="#endnote-4" id="endnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup>” presented the Oglala with a sacred pipe and seven sacred rites, providing the Oglala with wisdom, survival, and power<sup><a href="#endnote-5" id="endnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup>. While the buffalo represent all beings, otherwise known as <em>Wakan-Tanka, </em>they are also equated specifically with women. I was inspired by the bison’s central role in Oglala Lakota understandings of the natural world and social relationships, and as a poet I wanted to express my thoughts and feelings about the bison in verse. In the poetry that follows, I combine my recent encounters with bison in central Iowa at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge with what I’ve learned about the Oglala Lakota. I have learned about the Oglala Lakota’s relationship with bison from a mix of primary and secondary sources listed below. I have only begun to learn about the bison and the Oglala Lakota and recognize how much I do not know. My learning and application of it is shaped by my experiences, which are not indigenous.  <strong>watching the bison </strong> <em>do not come    too close to me</em>, he says, with strong brown eyes that   contain   the world.   She stands atop  packed black dirt,  Facing me  as I forget my self, forget my name, feel my breath, feel hers too   Shadows cast by the afternoon sun. reflecting their sacred bodies, moral behavior power survival entangled within their woolly dense fur  the <em>tatanka</em>,“buffalo,” are four-legged people<sup><a href="#endnote-6" id="endnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup>,   who hold a mystery of    sacred life, which travels    in dust  formed playfully wallowing, rubbing their backs   with packs of Earth’s colorful skin.  <strong>the prairie is a privilege </strong>A friend’s water bottle sticker reads, <em>the prairie is a privilege, </em>and I ask what that means to him. The prairie is a privilege, he says, with its mixed grasses, one of the most endangered ecosystems        in the world. The prairie is a privilege, home to sixty million bison for ten thousand years, until mass killing committed first by white hunters, who sold hides and meat, then by travelers, shooting from trains for greed.
