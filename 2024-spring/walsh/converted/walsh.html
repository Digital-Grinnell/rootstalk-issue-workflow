<p class="Emphasized-Paragraph">“Let a man decide upon his favorite animal and make a study of it…let him learn to
  understand its sounds and motions. The animals want to communicate with man, but Wakan-Tanka does not intend they
  shall do so directly – man must do the greater part in securing an understanding.” </p>

<p>Recently, I learned about the Oglala Lakota tribe’s history and relationship with bison, the largest land mammal in
  North America. In the mid-sixteenth century, the North American prairie was home to an estimated 40 million bison and
  tens of thousands of Lakota people. By the mid-nineteenth century, the bison had all but been eradicated and the
  Lakota population reduced forced into reservations. For the Oglala Lakota, bison are incredibly meaningful culturally
  and spiritually<sup><a href="#endnote-3" id="endnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup>. To them, the bison are one with the earth
  and represent all growing and living beings<sup><a href="#endnote-4" id="endnote-ref-4">[3]</a></sup>. In myth, the
  “White Buffalo Cow Woman<sup><a href="#endnote-5" id="endnote-ref-5">[4]</a></sup>” presented the Oglala with a sacred
  pipe and seven sacred rites, providing the Oglala with wisdom, survival, and power<sup><a href="#endnote-6"
      id="endnote-ref-6">[5]</a></sup>. While the buffalo represent all beings, otherwise known as <em>Wakan-Tanka,
  </em>they are also equated specifically with women. I was inspired by the bison’s central role in Oglala Lakota
  understandings of the natural world and social relationships, and as a poet I wanted to express my thoughts and
  feelings about the bison in verse. In the poetry that follows, I combine my recent encounters with bison in central
  Iowa at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge with what I’ve learned about the Oglala Lakota. I have learned about
  the Oglala Lakota’s relationship with bison from a mix of primary and secondary sources listed below. I have only
  begun to learn about the bison and the Oglala Lakota and recognize how much I do not know. My learning and application
  of it is shaped by my experiences, which are not indigenous. </p>
<h2 class="Title">watching the bison </h2>
<p class="Fixed-Format"><em>do not come    too close to me</em>, he says, with strong brown eyes that   contain   the
  world.   She stands atop  packed black dirt,  Facing me  as I forget my self, forget my name, feel my breath, feel
  hers too   Shadows cast by the afternoon sun. reflecting their sacred bodies, moral behavior power survival entangled
  within their woolly dense fur  the <em>tatanka</em>,“buffalo,” are four-legged people<sup><a href="#endnote-7"
      id="endnote-ref-7">[6]</a></sup>,   who hold a mystery of    sacred life, which travels    in dust  formed
  playfully wallowing, rubbing their backs   with packs of Earth’s colorful skin.  </p>
<h2 class="Title">the prairie is a privilege </h2>
<p class="Fixed-Format">A friend’s water bottle sticker reads, the prairie is a privilege, and I ask what that means to
  him. The prairie is a privilege, he says, with its mixed grasses, one of the most endangered ecosystems in the world.
  The prairie is a privilege, home to sixty million bison for ten thousand years, until mass killing committed first by
  white hunters, who sold hides and meat, then by travelers, shooting from trains for greed. In eighteen eighty-three
  the United States Army forced starving Native people deprived of their food and way of life to live on reservations,
  bringing Native Americans under U.S. government (white men) control “minimizingconflict”between Native Americans and
  foreign settlers “encouraging” Native Americans to “take on the ways of white men”<sup><a href="#endnote-8"
      id="endnote-ref-8">[7]</a></sup> The prairie is a privilege, holding within its rich roots the bleached white
  bones of sacred beings, once one of the most abundant large animals of all time.herds were stampeded by American
  military men for land and for freedom. maimed masses at the bottom of cliffs for the repression and deathof fellow
  human beings. </p>
<p class="Intense-Quote">“That animal (the bison) was like a part of ourselves, a part of our souls.” </p>

<h2 class="Title">becoming a woman</h2>
<p class="Fixed-Format">red smoke escapes into the sky from the buffalo cow as a calf is born, chokecherries and water
  are placed in a wooden bowl, a new woman and medicine man drink the red liquid like buffalo. She is painted red,
  sacred like her first menstrual flow. She is now a buffalo Woman, one with the White Buffalo Cow Woman, who brought
  sacred ceremonies so the Oglalas may live. Bison are one the universe, naturally containing the totality of all
  manifest forms of life <sup><a href="#endnote-10" id="endnote-ref-10">[9]</a></sup> </p><img

<h2 class="Title">excerpts and notes from Where Have All the Bison Gone?<em><sup><a href="#endnote-11"
        id="endnote-ref-11">[10]</a></sup></em></h2>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p class="Fixed-Format">without regular fire, woody plantsinvade the meadows, displacing the grass. more firearms than
  fire sent eastern bison on a long slow slide to oblivion. the bison do not run once hunters begin killing the herd.
  They do not flee the unknown cloud of black smoke from sharps rifles, <em>boom! </em>Why do the herd stand for
  slaughter?was it because the <em>boom </em>sounded like a thunderclap? or maybe, the bison were not scared of man.
  Bison are powerful animals, with hooves sinking deep into Earth.they turn directly to face harsh winter winds, shake
  their heads in snow to find buried grass. the Bison do not fear the human, but teach them to live well.</p><img

<h2 class="Title"><em>Maka Ina,‘</em>Mother Earth’</h2>
<p class="Fixed-Format"><em>Unšike,</em> ‘the pitiable,’<sup><a href="#endnote-12" id="endnote-ref-12">[11]</a></sup>
  some traditional Ogalala women believe in the pipe and the sacred rites.they pray to Wakantanka. Smoke the pipe and
  wait. they are concerned with <em>unšike</em>, the common people of the world. the white man is nothing more than a
  visitor to their world, one day destined to pass into oblivion. The buffalo and old Indigenous people will be born
  again. They look longingly out at the prairie, and wake from sleep with visions andpremonitions, sometimes visited by
  loved ones long passed. these Women are believed to be powerful because they are close to the spirit world. </p><img

    <p> I use the words bison and buffalo interchangeably here and am referring to the same animal, although technically
      the species <em>Bison bison </em>is not related to buffalo at all. I use them interchangeably because many of the
      sources I reference do so. <a href="#endnote-ref-4">↑</a></p>
