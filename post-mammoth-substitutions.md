# Post-Mammoth Substitutions

The following string substitutions should be automated in a script and applied to any/all article Markdown (`article-name.md`) files generated by Mammoth.  In the table the column on the left lists an HTML target as a `regex`.  The column on the right shows the corresponding _Rootstalk_ substitution. 

| HTML from Mammoth | Rootstalk Equivalent |
| ---               | ---                  |
| <h1 class="Primary-Title">(.+)</h1> | title: $1 |
| <p class="Byline">by (.+)</p> | byline: $1 |
