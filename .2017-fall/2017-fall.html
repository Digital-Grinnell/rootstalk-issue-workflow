In addition to being an artist trained at the Art Academy of Cincinnatti (http://www.artacademy.edu), he is (according to farm-owner John Freeberg) &quot;a singer and songwriter, landscaper and hardscaper, philosopher and roustabout.&quot; About his work on the</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> </span><span class="CharOverride-4">door, which Hickory Highlands Farm owner John Freeberg says is of wood and was found on the side of the road, Stenger says: &quot;I see the FarmHouse door as an entryway to a world apart—a sanctuary, a deep relaxation, a coming home. I tried to allow the door&apos;s imagery to reflect this experience—the colors of nature, experiences of living on the farm, the clouds in the sky on the day that I picked up the brush, and memories of my life growing up in the Midwest. All of it coalesced into what the door became.&quot; </span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">n the last ten months I have devoted countless hours of my time to a tiny piece of real estate on the southeast edge of the Grinnell College campus. There was not much there ten months ago: a few crab apple trees on the south side, a few pines on the north side, a large walnut tree on the west side, and a forlorn looking lawn in the middle, about six-tenths of an acre. There had been a house there once. But if one looked at the space with imagination one could see wonderful possibilities. And that’s how I had to look at it because it was the space the college said the Center for Prairie Studies could use for the new college garden. The old garden site had served us reasonably well since 2001. We had numerous garden beds, a shed and a greenhouse, a barrel to catch rain water off the roof of an adjacent college house, and a sentimental attachment to the location by way of the sweat equity that a series of student summer interns and I had put into it. But the site was being repurposed, and we had to relocate the garden.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">F</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ast forward ten months and be amazed, as I have been, at what we have accomplished. The operative word in the preceding sentence is “we.” So many people have helped. The parents of two current students from Minnesota donated two inch thick white oak lumber for building raised beds. A local farmer donated impossibly rich compost with which we filled the beds. Seed Savers Exchange (</span>https://www.seedsavers.org<span class="CharOverride-3">) in Decorah, Iowa, donated vegetable seeds and starts. Other farmers from east central Iowa donated more starts. The college’s Facilities Management department donated a hoop house frame. The college’s wonderfully talented environmental research station technician designed and led the installation of a drip irrigation system and, as I write, is organizing us to finish the hoop house. Current students (a few of them paid assistants), alumni, faculty, staff, and community members contributed time and energy to build twenty-one raised beds (three of them in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act), plant 30 varieties of produce, and weed, water, and harvest. Neighbors have come by to chat or to deliver their own food waste to our compost bins.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">C</span><span class="CharOverride-3">reating the garden has involved an inspiring display of community spirit. Community is one of the trio of concepts at the core of the Center for Prairie Studies’ mission The others are sustainability and place. Our vision for the garden is to create a place where we can nurture community around sustainably produced food. In the just-completed first growing season, we harvested over 700 pounds of produce, most of which went to the college’s Dining Services for many more people to enjoy. </span></p>

They have too much cement, too many cars and horns and sirens. They’re never truly dark. During my first week here in Iowa, I attended a bonfire out in the prairie. It felt so calm, so quiet. Beyond the welcoming glow of the campfire, I was surrounded by proper darkness, full of rustling prairie grasses, crickets, and, beyond the smaller noises, silence. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">A</span><span class="CharOverride-3">nd then I looked up.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">n the city, no one looks up anymore. You don’t miss much, maybe three to five stars if you’re lucky. Here it was different. I had never seen so many stars in my life. I could even see the Milky Way stretching itself across the sky. It’s hard to truly grasp how large the sky is. What you see is nothing, an insignificant fraction of a whole that could quite possibly go on forever.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">will keep the memory of that night’s sky in the prairie with me for the rest of my life. It felt impossibly large, and in turn I felt impossibly small. It also felt like it was welcoming me home, to this place where I was meant to be. As I made friends and ate s’mores around the fire, the sky twinkled up above, much more breathtaking than the glow-in-the-dark stickers on my bedroom ceiling. Whenever I walk places at night now, I always look up. </span></p>

They generally live near water, since their principal diet is small fish and crayfish.  They nest in burrows that they dig into earthen banks by water.  They must winter where the water does not freeze so they can continue to feed on aquatic life, which they take by diving into the water. The birds are stocky with a distinctive large and crested head, short legs, and medium length tails.   </span><a href=""></a></p>

I learned the use of tools and materials on dozens of simple ranch homes, using plans drafted by dad on spiral notebook pages. This led me organically, as a young adult, to pursue building and remodeling in Chicago. On weekends, I toured and studied the homes and public buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and his mentor, Louis Sullivan. I was inspired by their freeing of architectural design in this country from its European roots, creating a uniquely American aesthetic which was a synthesis of steel, brick, and stone underpinned by the lines and forms of nature. During the week, I would put these lessons into practice. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">F</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ast forward 40 years. My partner, Susan Walch, and I bought a brick bungalow in Fairfield, Iowa. We spent vast amounts of time renewing the home’s century-old Art and Crafts glory. It was a lovely place, but we often found ourselves in the evenings looking over magazine pictures that inspired us, dreaming of a home that we would someday build. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hen one day, while we were working out of town, we received a phone call telling us that our lovely house was on fire. After we’d made the four-hour drive home, we found a smoldering, total loss. We didn’t know it then, of course, but looking back on this disaster now, I can see that those ashes were the crucible of a boundary-breaking house. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">W</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hen we decided, after the fire, to build the house we’d been dreaming of, we came to our task with many questions, and few answers: How can a house honor and celebrate Mother Nature’s living presence, we asked? And how would we build such a house? Would building with materials that were more natural and less processed, bring the dweller closer to the heart of nature? What if the materials—to take a cue from the food movement’s “eat local” slogan—were drawn from our determination that we “build local”?  Would the look or feel of local materials make a difference, or be noticeable? And, of course, would the work entailed in sourcing these materials be worth the effort?</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">t’s been six years now since Susan and I began building what we eventually called the FarmHouse at Hickory Highlands, outside of Fairfield, Iowa, and I can honestly say that we have found answers to those questions and more. In the process, we have hosted over a thousand visitors, from a diverse array of states, nations, ages, occupations, and education levels. These visitors have expressed wonder, appreciation and joy as they’ve visited the house. I believe they’ve been responding to the materials, the design, the artistry, the comfort, and the uplifting feeling the space conveys. We did not intend to create a magical place but, magically, that is what happened. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">O</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ur journey began with a search for the right building site. We had already begun looking at numerous parcels of land before the fire, but that event gave us new focus. Eventually, we found an overworked 54-acre livestock and grain farm outside of Fairfield that had woods, a pond, and a rise on which to situate the house, which would provide us with an unobstructed view of the horizon, as well as a slight southerly slope which would allow the north wall to be bermed (tucked into the hill) reducing the house’s visual intrusion into the landscape, and providing shelter from the winter winds. It was perfect for our needs.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">N</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ow that we had a place to put the house, we began to look at the other features of the acreage. There were stands of timber with hardwood trees of a dozen species. A few of these would be harvested and sawn into boards at a nearby mill, to become the house’s trim, cabinets, doors, and furniture. There was also a pond which would provide water storage for domestic and agricultural use. As we considered these bounties, the floor plan of the FarmHouse began to come into focus. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">he house length would be oriented east-west. It would turn its back on the winter wind, and its south wall, with its large windows, would offer a view of the pond and the woods, as well as collect heat on sunny winter days. We decided the entry to the home would be via a stone-floored west porch. Anyone entering the snug foyer would get a glimpse of the gracious living-space within. We wanted a pathway of limestone flagstones which would lead from this beginning, through the house, past the living room, kitchen and out the east door to a screened porch. Along the north wall, we would put a guest nook, a mechanical room, a bathroom and, on the northeast, the master bedroom.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">here were other, less obvious decisions we made as well—features of the house which wouldn’t immediately be evident to the eye, but which would reflect our values and our concern with sustainability. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">S</span><span class="CharOverride-3">usan brought a particular set of skills to the creation of FarmHouse’s structure. While I had been a builder by profession, Susan had had numerous careers. None had been as fulfilling for her as house carpentry, or building exterior walls with straw bales and covering and protecting the bales with earthen plaster.  She had also taught the building of benches and ovens with a mixture of sand, </span>straw bales<span class="CharOverride-3">, and clay from the nearby ground—a combination known as “cob”. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">F</span><span class="CharOverride-3">or straw for our east and west exterior walls we turned to a neighboring organic farmer who supplied us with wheat straw bales. Straw bales have been used as building blocks since 1896 in Nebraska; they hold heat well in the winter and coolness in the summer. They resist penetration by wind, resist combustion and are a readily available local resource. Beyond these obvious advantages and their value as insulation, though, we love the look and feel of walls which are two feet thick, covered with earthen plaster and decorated with curved window wells. </span></p>

(http://www.caneloproject.com) They increased our knowledge-base many-fold during these events, and this knowledge enhanced both the structure and beauty of our FarmHouse.</span></p>

A foot beneath the topsoil was a layer of clay subsoil whose properties make it an excellent building material. It is sticky, it combines well with sand (to resist cracking) and straw (to provide a matrix which holds together on walls). Its resistance to moisture makes it usable as a plaster, a floor finish, and a material which is excellent for sculpting benches, earth ovens, even walls. The corner of the sunroom in the photo on p. 16 features a bench of cob.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">A</span><span class="CharOverride-3">s we continued to develop our vision, one of the greatest sources of support, in both the figurative and literal sense, came from the farm’s hickory trees. Their beauty and abundance at the farm’s higher elevations gave rise to the name Hickory Highlands. The idea of employing trees as structural members had first occurred to us during a day of scouring magazines years before. In several of the magazine features which caught our eyes, we saw photos of houses that had been designed by Roald Gunderson of Wisconsin, who was practicing what he called “whole-trees architecture” (http://www.wholetrees.com). Typically, trees are sawn into timbers, lumber, or boards to be used for construction. Gunderson’s idea was to use trees that are unmilled—or “whole”—as posts, beams and rafters, i.e. the frame. After we visited several homes he designed in Wisconsin, we decided to follow his system and use whole trees as the frame for our living room. We forwarded him the floor plan we had designed to that point, and commissioned him to create two exterior elevations which reflected his whole-tree aesthetic. Those drawings remained a source of inspiration for us during the years of construction. Gunderson has stopped by to visit several times when he has been in the area. &#9;</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">S</span><span class="CharOverride-3">usan and I determined that one of the most important features we wanted the house to have was a living room with a barrel vault (curved) ceiling. Hickory trees mostly grow straight and tall, but in our stand of timber there were two hickories which had matching, curved trunks. This was only one of many such serendipitous occurrences which helped us in our building of the FarmHouse. These trees provide the defining ceiling/roof beams which made the barrel vault we wanted possible. The eight- to eleven-inch diameters of these trees determined the nine- to ten-inch diameters of the supporting posts and the six- to seven-inch rafters. Consulting with Roald Gunderson, we learned that harvesting trees in the spring, when the sap is running, would allow the thick bark to peel off easily. When we had harvested our hickories and debarking was completed, it revealed a shimmering sapwood of surreal beauty, which has been a source of continuing amazement for our visitors.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">W</span><span class="CharOverride-3">e completed other architectural elements in the FarmHouse without considering, “How long will this take?” Our friend Dennis Kossow, working an hour or two a day for many weeks, built our hearth using stones from my grandfather’s Wisconsin farm, and I think the finished product conveys strength with an air of whimsy. Our rainbow-colored soffit boards are made of cottonwood sawn at the nearby mill. The honey locust boards which face the kitchen cabinets were sanded at a diesel-powered Amish shop. Susan laid the flagstone path leading through the house using limestone from the quarry in Anamosa, Iowa. It’s likely that the same quarry provided limestone for the Sullivan-designed jewel box bank in Grinnell and the Wright-designed Miller home in Charles City.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">S</span><span class="CharOverride-3">usan and I did most of the work on the FarmHouse. As artisan-builders we had lots of support in our desire to build with local materials: our friend Lou Bolster brought us a case of blue bottles for the “stained glass window” in the bedroom. Neighbors with fallen-down barns allowed us to salvage weathered siding for wall coverings and rusted, corrugated roofing for ceiling material.  We found a double drainboard cast-iron sink on Craigslist and made the trip from Des Moines to Fairfield with it strapped to the top of our car. Windows and doors came from the ReStore, and even from the roadside. We found resources as we needed them.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hese included “human resources.” We had a few interns along the way—our first interns being Joshua Vojtisek, Emily Breffle, and Jacob Roberts—from the Maharishi University of Management Sustainable Living Program (</span>https://www.mum.edu/academic-departments/sustainable-living<span class="CharOverride-3">), who worked alongside us on the first six, very hot weeks of construction, raising the FarmHouse from bare earth and seeing it through until we had a roof which would shed water. They have all been back to visit and view the project as a significant chapter in their lives.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">W</span><span class="CharOverride-3">e also depended on the skilled work of a number of sub-contractors. I did a work-trade with a friend, Eric Hoffman, helping him install siding on his house and then he helped shingle the walls of our house. Tony Stenger, who has a painting studio in one of the four “tiny home” structures which are also on the farm, built the rustic, undulating urbanite retaining walls around the FarmHouse, and he painted a pastoral scene on our salvaged front door (see this issue&apos;s front cover). </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">W</span><span class="CharOverride-3">e’ve also hosted occasional work parties. We are grateful for all this assistance. The FarmHouse could not have been completed without it. Along with our vision, our connection with the land and the materials, it was a big part of what kept us going for six years. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">O</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ur years of building experience allowed us to make design decisions as we built. I made mockups and drew sketches to communicate ideas for solutions to design issues. To work out every detail of construction before building would have been tedious, cumbersome, and unnecessary. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hat being said, we carefully designed FarmHouse’s numerous support systems—heating, cooling, water, black water, and electric—with an eye toward sustainability and redundancy. Take cooling, for example: there are abundant operable windows, allowing for good ventilation. Transoms above the bedroom and bathroom doors allow for air movement even when the doors are closed. In the summer, windows are open at night to allow the cool air to flow into the house, then are closed in the morning to keep the </span>coolness in and warmth out.<span class="CharOverride-3"> Porches to the east and west combine with eave overhangs to keep the sun from overheating the house. Sun shades on the east bedroom window and the east bump-out window keep the summer morning sun out while allowing a diffused light in. A ceiling fan in the living room gently moves air around the entire house. We also installed two 100-foot-long, six-inch tubes eight feet deep in the earth. A fan drives filtered outdoor air slowly through the tubes, where it picks up the earth’s latent 58-degree temperature and delivers the chilled air into the house. Finally, on sunny summer days, when extra coolness is welcome, there is enough solar electricity generated by our off-grid system to run a small window air conditioner. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">H</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ow much did the FarmHouse cost to build? Materials, subcontractors and tool rental totaled $155,000, not including land. Susan and I spent approximately 24,500 hours over six years. At one dollar per hour, that’s $24,500. Add in the hundreds of hours of service friends and interns put in—hours which were great fun, but impossible to put a price-tag on—and the cost—and the value delivered—quickly becomes incalculable. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">W</span><span class="CharOverride-3">e have enjoyed living in the house for two years. In fact, we have a hard time leaving, even to make the two-mile trip to town. We love that it looks as if it has emerged from the earth, just like the trees which make its frame. It has a casual, pleasing feel, like a favorite shirt or song. Tucked into its site, its west entrance is partially concealed by raised gardens along the curving entry walk which feature an eclectic mix of annuals and perennials, flowers and trees, weeds and edibles. Buffering the winter winds is a row of conifers 70 feet northwest of the house. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">O</span><span class="CharOverride-3">nce a year now, we host an open house to expose visitors to new possibilities in home design and to show them that it’s possible to build with natural, recycled or upcycled materials obtained from close by. We occasionally hold a house concert, preceding it with a potluck meal. These events are unique in that some people come only for the potluck, some only for the music, although most come for both. If we move some furniture out to the porch and bring in folding chairs, we can seat up to 50 people. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">O</span><span class="CharOverride-3">nce visitors had begun coming through the FarmHouse, we found that in building with natural materials and methods we had unintentionally evoked a multitude of traditions which spelled “home” for people from many different places. One visitor commented that the Dutch door between the kitchen and the screened porch reminded her of doors in her native Hungary. A woman from Venezuela put her hands on an earth plaster wall saying it reminded her of home. Another visitor, from Siberia, expressed happiness that we had included cow manure in our plaster mixes, just as her family did back in Russia. A professor from India said our three-part south window was reminiscent of windows in Rajasthan. Numerous visitors have commented that our adobe floors and round wood rafters—vigas—have the flavor of the American Indian and Spanish architecture of the Southwest. And earthen roofs like ours are used in many places in the world, including Scandinavia, where my own ethnic roots lie. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">G</span><span class="CharOverride-3">uests and visitors enjoy the views from the FarmHouse. The porches, the windows, and the seating provide inspiring vistas of sunsets, mists over the forests, creek valley, pond and fields. </span>But more significant than the views are the abundant beauty, silence, comfort, charm, and joy which are native, embedded qualities of the land.<span class="CharOverride-3"> These characteristics were not inherent in our plan and elevations, nor were they even our intention as owner-builders. Rather, they were embodied, I think, in the local materials, whose living essence flowed from them as they were lovingly harvested from field or quarry or woodland, installed, and appreciated. Paying attention to their silent language has yielded a home which, like the forest itself, is pleasing, peaceful, and lively.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">W</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hat would our advice be for a person wanting to live in a home like the FarmHouse? Practice swinging a hammer, wielding a chainsaw or using whatever tools you need to accomplish your goal.  Take workshops focusing on your favorite materials or techniques—straw bales, cord wood or earth plaster. Build something small and useful—a greenhouse, a tool shed or an animal shelter. Volunteer to work for people who are doing what you wish to do. Pick your place to build. Spend time there, and the place will speak to you. </span></p>

It measured just 50 by 100 feet and had elaborate murals on the walls to the left and right of the grand stage. The stage was masked by a hand-painted tapestry that hung down and brushed the wood floor beneath it. The building itself has seen many changes during the century since its opening, but throughout its history it has provided Toledo with a warm environment where the community has been able to experience the arts and enjoy time spent with one another.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-11">History</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">he Wieting was named for the family of Dr. P. G. Wieting and his wife, Helen, who moved to Toledo, Iowa, in 1867 from Worchester, New York. Dr. Wieting was a practicing dentist and later a successful bank owner with his father-in-law, N. H. Wilder. They opened the bank together and called it the Toledo City Bank. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">L</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ater the Wietings would move back to New York, this time to Syracuse, where they once again found success. The Wietings never forgot Toledo, though, and later, after Dr. Wieting passed away, Helen decided to honor her late husband by donating money from his estate for a good cause. Helen bequeathed money to build a theatre in each of the three towns where they had resided, one theatre in Worchester, New York, one in Syracuse, and one in Toledo. The theatres were dedicated to the memory of Dr. Wieting and also served to celebrate Mrs. Wieting’s passion for the arts. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">A</span><span class="CharOverride-3">fter Helen Wieting made a $20,000 donation from her husband’s estate, construction of the Wieting Theatre began swiftly. The project was started in March of 1912 and completed by September of that same year. The Wieting Theatre Opera House was ready to open its doors. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">n its original grandeur, the theatre contained 650 seats and was equipped with a stage, an orchestra pit, a box office, bathrooms, a balcony, and dressing rooms. The building had a red brick exterior, with stately, white pillars framing the front door.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">A</span><span class="CharOverride-3">lthough the Wieting Theatre began as an opera house, it was host to various events since its inception. The opening night event was Verdi’s “II Trovatore.” Joseph Sheehan was a famous tenor at the time and the star of the show. At that time the venue was used to host traveling shows and musicians, graduations, high school and college plays and productions, political conventions, and minstrel shows. </span>The Wieting has always been a resource to everyone in the community<span class="CharOverride-3">—</span>even for those that its supporters disagree with. As noted in the history hall, there was once a Ku Klux Klan gathering held at the theatre, an occurrence that is an outlier from the otherwise inclusive community that the theatre now condones. <span class="CharOverride-3">And within a year of the doors opening, the Wieting began to show films. The films were silent, and local talents were hired to accompany the films on piano. Twenty years later, the silent films turned into “talking picture” shows. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">B</span><span class="CharOverride-3">y the late 1950’s, the Wieting began to experience competition for film showings from the opening of other movie houses in the Toledo area. Additionally, the rise of television drove down demand for theatre movie showings. Eventually the Wieting was barely staying open, running only on a part-time schedule until the fall of 1958, when the theatre’s management decided that it was no longer feasible to keep the Wieting operating, and it was shut down. A layer of dust formed over the seats, the stage curtains stayed in place, and the doors remained locked.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-11">Resurrected by volunteers</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">he Wieting’s closure left a hole in the community. No other venue was home to the arts like the Wieting had been for 56 years. After a year and half, though, community members began to gather and talk about the possibility of reopening the theatre. A group of women gathered to discuss its importance in the community and, shortly after, convened to seriously evaluate the building’s fate. That day in April of 1960, 40 people gathered to create a vision for the future of the theatre. That became the first of many recurring meetings that still happen today. These community members turned into a guild of regular volunteers for the theatre and, a month after their first meeting, they wrote a constitution to guide their efforts, and immediately set to work to restore and reopen the Wieting Theatre. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">he volunteers did not waste time, spending the whole summer working to learn the ins and outs of running the theatre as a business. If they were going to reopen the Wieting successfully, they reasoned, they wanted to know how to keep it in operation long-term. An executive committee was set up to spearhead the reopening, consisting of members Leo Benda, Dallas Sloan, Mrs. Willard Beadle, Mrs. Virgil Wulff, and Mrs. Charles Maplethorpe Jr. These five guild executives were active members of the community. For example, Leo Benda worked as a manager at the local post office and later became a Tama County Supervisor and Helen Beadle owned her own fabric store in Toledo called “Sunrise Sotique.”</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">o prepare for the reopening, these executive members, as well as other guild volunteers, spent many hours restoring the theatre. Volunteers painted the lobby, the front doors and the pillars that framed them. They installed a new movie screen, box office, and carpeting. In addition to overseeing this work, the guild also took in monetary donations. One business bought $60 worth of tickets which, at that time, covered the cost of 200 children’s tickets to see a show. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">W</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hen reopening day came on September 16th of 1960, the Wieting was filled to capacity. That night two movies were shown, “The Boy and the Pirates” and Disney’s “White Wilderness.” The Wieting began selling family season tickets. Each of the five executive members bought season tickets, and their combined purchase totaled $100. Soon, 100 more family season tickets were sold, bringing in money to help the theatre get back on its feet. In attendance at the reopening event were Dr. and Mrs. Knight Fee, who also attended the original opening in 1912. While there were some community members who were able to experience both of these opening events, others experienced the Wieting for the first time that night.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">his success story could never have come to be without the countless volunteer efforts and the drive to keep the Wieting a home to the arts in the Tama-Toledo community. The volunteers were vital to the theatre’s reopening in 1960, and still continue to be essential to the Wieting’s success. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">oday, the theatre stays open thanks to nearly 150 community members who regularly volunteer their time for the Wieting. The volunteers attend meetings, run concessions, collect tickets, greet guests and work behind-the-scenes to keep the theatre operating smoothly. The current support staff, consisting of the guild President and a few dedicated members who oversee daily operations, volunteer a combined 25-40 hours per week for the theatre. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">t should be no surprise to learn that many of today’s guild of Wieting Theatre volunteers are highly involved in many aspects of the community. Denise Fletcher, a dedicated volunteer and the current guild President, is a retired fourth-grade teacher who is highly regarded in the South Tama school district. About her volunteer work, Fletcher says, “Life can be broken down into three stages. As a child you receive the benefit of other people’s experience and wisdom. In the second stage you begin to give to your family and career. Now as a retiree I feel I have the privilege to give back to my community. I choose to spend my time serving on the Wieting Theatre Guild. I feel that I continue to grow as a person by learning new things, meeting new people and striving to meet the needs of our community.”</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3"> </span><span class="CharOverride-3">&#9;The commitment demonstrated by volunteers like Fletcher would be necessary again in the early 2000s, when the Wieting faced challenges similar to those it faced in 1958. With movie rentals on the rise, families were opting to stay at home to watch movies rather than attending showings at the theatre. Additionally, many of the theatre seats were broken and the film equipment would often break down during movie showings. Volunteer projectionists would scamper to try to splice the films quickly to get them running again before guests would leave. It was very challenging to keep the theatre in the black during this time, and some of the guild members even paid the Wieting’s bills with their own money. Despite these hardships, the volunteers were determined to keep the theatre open and were hopeful that the community would support their efforts.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-11">Renovations</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">O</span><span class="CharOverride-3">nce again, a group of guild members got together and started planning the salvation of Toledo’s cherished community resource. The volunteers imagined a renovated theatre with new seats and better lighting. The community ultimately supported the decision to fund this $1.4 million-dollar renovation project. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">n addition to holding special fundraising events —including raffles, trivia nights, and themed dinners— businesses and residents were solicited for cash donations.

This hall is an important timeline for the theatre and also serves to thank the community and show appreciation for the Wieting’s generous donors.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">A </span><span class="CharOverride-3">sponsorship program was put in place to help reduce the overall costs of renovations. Donors were able to sponsor individual theatre seats, or more than one if they were inclined, for the price of $375 per seat. After they did so, their names were placed on a plaque that honored all of the donors, and was placed in the history hall. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">A</span><span class="CharOverride-3">fter volunteers worked tirelessly to plan and host fundraising events, and with overwhelming help from grants and donations, the Wieting reached its fundraising goals. The theatre was shut down for a year in 2011 to complete the renovations. Beside the new additions to the theatre, the murals on either side of the stage were restored. The original hand-painted tapestry, which had hung over the stage since the Wieting opened, was kept in place. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">he Wieting’s reopening was a marvelous success, with the average attendance for events more than doubling over the following year. Before renovations, average attendance had been in the low 20s. After, the average climbed to 56 people per night. The average income two years after the reopening was triple what it had been before the renovations. The theatre continued to be a place where community members could gather to watch movies and enjoy events. Even after these extensive renovations, the volunteer-run aspect of the theatre currently allows it to show movies for $3 for 2-D movies and $4 for movies shown in 3-D, with recent releases playing every weekend, Friday through Sunday and Thursday through Sunday in the summer months. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">L</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ooking ahead, the volunteers are now focused on planning and fundraising for a second phase of renovations to the theatre. The upcoming phase will focus on improvements to the theatre which are more behind-the-scenes than the previous renovations were.  The goal of this phase is to restore live theatre performances to the Wieting’s stage. One of the main facets of the renovation is installing completely new lighting and rigging to make the space better equipped to host theatre performances. To complete these lighting renovations, improvements to the Wieting’s roof structure will be necessary. Improvements to the basement are also planned, to repair existing water damage.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">he renovation also calls for upgrades to the backstage areas including the green room, restrooms, and make-up and storage areas.

Michael Emerson (</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Emerson<span class="CharOverride-3">), renowned for his role as Benjamin Linus in the American drama series “Lost,” graduated from South Tama and performed at the Wieting during high school.

Emerson stated, “We need to go that extra step to save this old-time theatre. A lot of us have histories here.” The article also mentions teachers who were particularly influential for Emerson during high school, including a community member and former teacher who is still helping the theatre today. </span></p>

For a recent fundraiser Michael co-wrote a reader’s theatre piece with another former English teacher, Mary Fasse-Shaw. The humorous performance of this murder mystery piece titled “Mysterious, Gruesome, Yet Morbidly Fascinating Murder at the Wieting,” filled the house. The audience roared with laughter throughout the performance.  The fundraiser was co-hosted with another local group, the Kiwanis Club. The event itself was free to attend, but free-will donations totaled over $2,200, bringing in about $1,100 for each organization, with the Wieting’s portion going towards the second phase of renovations. </span></p>

Usually three actors from the troupe come to teach about 60 elementary and middle school students. When camp is in session, kids come to the Wieting every day to learn a musical, which they then perform for the community at week’s end. Parents and community members alike are more than happy to buy tickets to see the musical put on at the end of camp, and so the event also serves as a fundraising opportunity. </span></p>

The series, which started in 2014, honors all types of performing artists that travel to the community from one of the public universities in Iowa. Each season is comprised of four or five different shows, and in the past performers from both the University of Iowa and the University of Northern Iowa (</span>https://uni.edu)<span class="CharOverride-3"> have gladly shared their talents with the community. The Fine Arts Performance Series has hosted musicians, dancers, singers, and musical theatre. Not only does the series create connections within the community and the state, but it also inspires high school students who are interested in pursuing the arts as part of their post-secondary education.</span></p>

I have many fond recollections of both performing and being an audience member at the theatre. From kindergarten through my senior year of high school I took dance lessons at the community center next door to the theatre. Up until the Wieting was shut down for the first phase of renovations in 2011, our yearly dance recitals were held at the Wieting. During my middle and elementary school years, my classmates and I would get changed into our costumes, slip on our ballet shoes and tiptoe to a small side door of the theatre that led directly backstage. We would huddle close together, waiting. I was always filled with such unequivocal excitement, sometimes peeking out from the sides of the stage to search for familiar faces. I remember watching the older girls dance their routine before we were able to take our places on center stage.</span></p>

The theatre decided to host a master class ahead of their performance to teach a dance to interested students. I signed up and attended the master class, which took place during March of my junior year of high school. We learned “modern” dance, which was quite different in style from the ballet moves to which I was accustomed. I was amused that we were directed to keep our feet flat and told that our arms could form any shape we desired; we were not restricted to rounded arms and pointed feet. It was an entirely new dance experience for me. This class gave me the courage to enroll in a modern dance course during my second semester at the University of Iowa.</span></p>

My movements were slow and deliberate, the stage was smooth and cold. I leapt and I breathed and I spun and at the end of the song, I took a bow. That was the last time I danced on that beautiful, timeless stage.  </span></p>

It feeds on sunflower and nyjer seed, and often flocks with Common Redpolls during the winter months. In the spring, males are bright yellow with a black forehead, while females are olive colored above their tail and pale yellow beneath. In the winter, these finches turn a dull brown with black wings. Their call is high pitched, and often given during flight. The American Goldfinch lives in fields and floodplains, especially around plants such as asters and thistles, as well as in orchards and backyards.

Since its founding as a pharmaceutical firm in 1901, Monsanto has had a hand in many advances which have literally shaped the modern world. Among the products Monsanto or its subsidiaries have developed or produced are the artificial sweetener saccharin, vanillin, aspirin (and its raw ingredient salicylic acid), and such basic industrial chemicals such as sulfuric acid and PCBs. Its research labs helped with the Manhattan Project and later became involved in the development of DDT, “All” fabric detergent, Agent Orange, Astroturf, L-Dopa, and light-emitting diodes. The company was one of the first to genetically modify a plant cell, and in more recent years, through its patents, strategic mergers, and acquisitions of the seed businesses of such companies as Dekalb, Cargill, and Seminis, Inc., the company has become the world’s largest seed company, parlaying its GMO patents into vastly profitable product lines.  </span></p>

Once absorbed into the leaves, glyphosate cannot be broken down. The glyphosate moves quickly through the plant and accumulates in areas of active growth called meristems.

Within a week or so, many plant tissues and parts slowly degrade due to lack of proteins.

Dunham’s medical training has enabled him to do a deep dive into the science surrounding glyphosate, and he has had a ground-level view of the compound’s effects on the animals he has encountered in his practice. As he educated himself on the subject, what he found at first intrigued, then ultimately alarmed him. He has become convinced that glyphosate has deeply penetrated too much of our food supply and some of our water supply, and that it is causing both short- and long-term damage to our ecosystem, as well as to the health of both livestock and humans.</span></p>

			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Glyphosate is the active ingredient of Roundup, really the most popular herbicide in the world. It’s N-phosphonomethyl glycine... a phosphonate chemical [that] was patented first by Stauffer Chemical company in 1964 as a descaler for metal pipes. It was then patented in 1974 [by Monsanto] as a herbicide. And in 2010, it was patented as a human antibiotic and parasite control agent [because] it has activity against gonorrhea and malaria. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> Is glyphosate being used as an antibiotic today?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Glyphosate has [never actually been] used as an antibiotic. [Monsanto] applied for the patent in 2002 and they got it in 2010, but they’ve never [sold it as such]. [Glyphosate’s] main use is as a herbicide and a drying agent. By drying agent, I mean that [farmers] are using it pre-harvest to dry down the crop, to kill it. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> Why has Roundup/glyphosate become the most widely used herbicide?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Well, number one, it’s cheap. And the other thing is, it’s been super-effective. It’s let farmers farm more acres with less labor. One farmer can handle way more ground. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> How did you become interested in it?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> I got more interested in this whole thing as a veterinarian in 2005-2006, [when] I had five different dairies where I had stillborn, aborted calves. I sent in their livers to Iowa State University after reading my Dairy NRC [Nutrient Requirements for Cattle], and I had them check them for [the mineral] manganese. Their machine couldn’t even find any.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> And manganese is necessary for normal fetal development…. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> [Right.] So then, I talked to the fellow that wrote the mineral section of the Dairy NRC and he said, “Well Art, there’s plenty of manganese in No. 2 Yellow Corn. There’s plenty of manganese in soybeans and there’s plenty of manganese in haylage [livestock feed made from perennial forages such as grasses and legumes] and corn silage.” I kept saying, “Well, how come the machine at Iowa State [can’t find the nutrient in the calves’ livers]?” And the guy I talked to didn’t have a good answer. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;One of the dairymen [whose calves I was looking at] was mad at my two partners and me because we weren’t really helping him. Our vaccine program wasn’t working that good. He had John Deere tractors, so he had a copy of the [company’s magazine], <a href=""><span class="CharOverride-46">John Deere Furrow</span></a>, (www.johndeerefurrow.com) for the spring of 2007. The client put me onto it; he [understood what was going on] before I did. He shoved the issue in front of my face, and he said, “Art, maybe you’ll be interested in this.” Well, I sure was! </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;In that issue, there was an article by this <a href="">Purdue University</a> (http://www.purdue.edu) professor named <a href="">Don Huber (https://geneticliteracyproject.org/glp-facts/don-huber-science-still-looking-for-purdue-professors-gmo-pathogen-time-bomb), </a>[who was] talking about glyphosate tying up manganese, and maybe we should start looking for an alternative. I tried to get the experts at <a href="">Iowa State University</a> to phone him up. They wouldn’t do it, so I did. And then, see, that’s where we developed that relationship, in 2007. He’s retired now but still living in Idaho. He’s originally from out there. And when I say he’s retired, he’s still working. He’s [consulting] in Australia right now. He’s 82, and he’s still working on this. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;[Huber] worked at [the <a href="">United States Army Medical Command</a> <span class="CharOverride-4">(</span><span class="CharOverride-46">http://mrmc.amedd.army.mil</span><span class="CharOverride-4">) </span>installation at] Fort Detrick [Maryland] on biological warfare agents, so he’s an expert on ricin and Agent Orange. He was the head of our government’s Plant Pathogen Threat Committee for 25 years…. He has consulted [on crops] on every continent but Antarctica. [So] I really got onto [glyphosate after I talked to him]. I still remember the phone call. [I had] called him up two weeks before [this], and I didn’t hear from him and I didn’t hear from him, and I thought he’d just blown me off because I tend to ask questions and then see if people can answer them, and then I never hear from them. But he phoned me and apologized for taking so long to get back to me. He said: “I’ve been in Russia on government business.”</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;Anyway, in that conversation I [brought up] the article he wrote in the <span class="CharOverride-46">John Deere Furrow</span>, and I said, “You’re from Purdue. It’s a land grant college like Iowa State, isn’t it? It’s pretty brave to come right out and say ‘We ought to be looking for an alternative to glyphosate!’ How could you write that in there? How do you get any grant money? How can you do any studies?” </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> How did he answer?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> He’s a little bitty guy, but he has a real deep bass voice. He went, “Heh, heh, heh, Art; I’m 72 years old, and I’m supposedly retired. I don’t have to [publish] or apply for grant money anymore, and I can call it like I see it.”</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> And this was when he said glyphosate might be the issue?  </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Yeah. [In] his article, he talks about the fusarium mycotoxins [fungal contaminants of food and animal feed] that I’m seeing, and that [he said] glyphosate helps increase the risk of. So, everything just…. It just made sense…. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> How did Don Huber get interested in glyphosate?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> He did the half-life studies for Monsanto in the early 70s, to get it approved as a herbicide. [Later], he realized that his science was flawed. So now he’s trying to make amends for that by getting the word out.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"> </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> The science was flawed? How? </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Glyphosate [concentrates at the plant’s growth points—the joints of the stalk, the root-tips, and the grain]. When [Monsanto] did the studies on corn to determine the half-life [of the chemical], they did it after they’d sold the corn grains, so they got rid of a third of it there. Then they sold the corn [stalks for] fodder, and because [glyphosate concentrates] in the joints of the stalk, they got rid of another third of it there. So that just left the third that went to the root tips to study. But [when they tested it] they didn’t do the studies in soil. They did the studies in beakers of solution at room temperature. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> So, they weren’t measuring the full concentration of glyphosate in the environment. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> [There are only] certain bacteria and fungi that can break [glyphosate] down. The more bacteria you have in your soil, the more diversity you have, [and the shorter the period of time] you’ve used [glyphosate], the faster it will break down. So now they’re figuring out that [glyphosate’s] half-life can be as long as 11 years. So, [over time] it’s [been] building up. That&apos;s why, as a veterinarian, I didn’t really start seeing issues with it—let’s see, we started using it in ’74, and then we didn’t start using it big-time until 1996 when we had Roundup Ready soybeans and in 1998 with Roundup Ready corn. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk: </span>And one of the selling-points of Roundup-Ready crops was that farmers wouldn’t have to use as much herbicide for it to be effective….</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Remember, our whole ag business industry [said]: “Oh, we’ve got to have GMO because we’re going to use less chemical.” [So, with Roundup Ready crops] we maybe used fewer of the other herbicides that we said were more risky—which, actually, when we knew they were risky, we handled them more carefully. We couldn’t put them on indiscriminately after the crop was alive and growing, and we didn’t have to worry about near as much carry-over because they rinsed off. And there’s nothing in the Roundup Ready plant that breaks down glyphosate for you. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> So, glyphosate was building up in the soil because farmers were using more of it. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham: </span>Yes. It’s just the opposite of what we hear. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;When we drove the corn price up and really started pushing [corn-based] ethanol, wheat wasn’t priced that good. So, Kansas farmers, Nebraska farmers, Oklahoma farmers, that had center pivot irrigation and had enough well water…switched to corn, and it was Roundup corn. Then, when things got a little bit cheaper on the corn they tried switching back to wheat. Guess what? You’ve got enough [glyphosate] carry-over, and unless you’re getting lots of feedlot manure and you’re doing some other things that have some bacterial action to break down [the glyphosate], when you plant your wheat, you’ve got a pitiful stand. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> Because the glyphosate is still in the soil. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> [Yes.] And Monsanto has paid out considerable amounts of money [in legal settlements] without anybody knowing about it, because the way our court system works, see, when the farmer gets paid, he has to sign, “I can’t say anything.” And, again, only because of the group of other concerned people I’m working with, do I know anything about that.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> So, what would you say are your main concerns about glyphosate? </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham: </span>My main concerns are human. And soil. </p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">&#9;</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">D</span><span class="CharOverride-4">unham explained that glyphosate’s impact on livestock and humanity stems from a cascade effect: when glyphosate is applied to a crop in the field, in addition to killing undesirable plants, its antibiotic properties damage the soil bacteria which normally add to soil tilth and organic matter. This—along with the heavier application of glyphosate to fields in which Roundup Ready crops are growing—leads to a concentration of glyphosate in the soil itself, as well as percolation of the chemical into groundwater. With glyphosate remnant in the soil, unless the farmer continues to plant glyphosate-resistant crops, yields in treated fields can fall. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">hen there are the chemical’s negative effects on livestock. When animals consume Roundup-treated plant material, it causes an impoverishment of the animals’ gut-biome, making it harder for the animal to absorb micronutrients—including the manganese whose absence Dunham noted in the fetal calves of his clients’ dairy herds. This leads to animals which, when they don’t die in utero, often suffer health problems before they reach market. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">R</span><span class="CharOverride-4">esearchers have begun to look into whether these effects are also passing up the food-chain to humans. The thinking is that, with glyphosate accumulating in plant tissues and (in smaller amounts) in the animal protein we consume, as well as in some of the water we drink, the chemical has begun accumulating also in the tissues of the human population, leading to a host of medical problems. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> So, you’ve talked about glyphosate’s effect on fetal dairy cattle—their inability to absorb manganese. Can you describe some of the other effects on the animal and human populations which some researchers are linking to this growing concentration of glyphosate? </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Well, [one effect is from Vitamin] B-12 deficiency [which leads to] demyelination. This is the degrading of the myelin sheath covering the nerve cells—just like having electrical wires that don’t have good insulation. So, it could be your spinal cord. It can be peripheral nerves. And animals and people have all sorts of demyelinating disease processes.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> Can you cite any instances in which you’ve seen this problem crop up?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham: </span>Probably in 2010 or 2009—it was after I met Huber—there was another person, Dr. Mike Sheridan, a world-wide known swine consultant from western Canada. who had been working with these big farrowing set-ups in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, for a great big Hutterite colony, and they’re kicking out 130,000 hogs a year, farrow-to-finish.. [This vet had] run into a bunch of animals he called “squatter pigs” because they’re going down in the rear end. Three percent of these 130,000 hogs are going down in the rear end. Well, [in this operation they didn’t] feed corn. They [fed the pigs] barley, wheat, and rye [which had been dried down with Roundup]. They fed that to the sows. And the best way for a baby to be Vitamin B-12 deficient is if the mother is deficient. So, they were feeding [Roundup-finished] grain to both the sows and the [juvenile] pigs. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;This guy ended up sending tissue [from these “squatter” pigs] to two vet schools. He cut into their spinal columns and sent them in…. And they looked at it and they told him that it was Vitamin B-12 deficiency causing this. Well, then, he knew he really had something problematic, so they sent it to a human medical school and they told him the same thing. So… he decided to put in 10x Vitamin B-12 in the feed. It isn’t that expensive. And he put in more [Vitamin B-9], too. [This] only lowered the incidence maybe in half.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;This vet was on the <a href="">American Association of Swine Veterinarians</a> <span class="CharOverride-4">(</span>https://www.aasv.org<span class="CharOverride-4">) </span>listserve, so he puts a question on there either in 2009 or 2010 and he says, “Can somebody help me? What the heck’s going on?” </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> Because the B-12 supplements should have taken care of the deficiency….</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> It should have. So, he had his phone number on [his email]. So, I phoned him up, and I said “Mike, is there any chance that Hutterite colony quit windrowing their barley, wheat, and rye and they started spraying it dead with glyphosate?” And he says—I still really remember this conversation too—he says, “WHAT? What are you talking about?” And I told him “You’d better check it out.” </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;So, he checked it out. [The Hutterite operation was] big enough, so they were buying some of their feed, too. So… they went back to [drying their grain in windrows]. And guess what? Their problem disappeared. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;Too much of [the grain crop is desiccated using glyphosate]. I’m not saying all [of it]—but a lot of it is. And so, [glyphosate acts as an antibiotic] when you eat the wheat. [This is where] I get arguments from my veterinary colleagues because they say, “Oh, it’s too low a dose. It’s too low a dose.”  </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;And yet [look at what we’re doing] in hog practice…. [We’re] trying to cut back on low levels of feed-grade antibiotics so we don’t create resistance. And we’re trying to be more responsible. [But at the same time] we’re using [glyphosate] as a herbicide and throwing it at everything. What I’m trying to tell you is that, in parts per million—when you’re dealing with an aminoglycoside antibiotic, like Neomycin or Gentamicin, Amikacin, and if you are trying to kill off E. coli in the gut of a pig with post-weaning scours—you don’t have to dose him at one milligram per pound of bodyweight, or two or three. You can [get that effect with] a real small [dose]—just in parts per million in the animal’s gastrointestinal tract. With the glyphosate [antibiotic] patent, they come right out and say one to two parts per million is an adequate dose. And then we’re spraying half a part per million or better. And then we’ve got carry over…. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> Any other researchers whose work supports these conclusions? </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Dr. Monika Krüger<span class="CharOverride-47">8</span>  is another real important [person].

She’s a researcher. She’s retired now, too. She was at Leipzig, Germany, at the University of Leipzig. In northeast Germany. She was behind the Iron Curtain, and Monsanto and agribusiness knew nothing of her. I met her in China in 2014. Then I saw her again, [when] she testified [in October 2016] at The Hague [concerning glyphosate]<span class="CharOverride-47">9</span>. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;She’s got a Ph.D. in microbiology, a Ph.D. in mycology (the study of fungus), a Ph.D. in veterinary pathology, and she worked at a human hospital before she retired. Her field of expertise is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. And she’s a botulism expert.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;So… anyway, she’s shown that at one tenth of one part per million in the gut, that’s a high enough level of glyphosate that it kills off <span class="CharOverride-46">Enterococcus faecalis</span> and <span class="CharOverride-46">faecium</span> that somehow produce bacteriocins [toxins produced by bacteria which inhibit the growth of similar or closely related bacterial strain(s)], which normally keep <span class="CharOverride-46">Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium novyi</span> and <span class="CharOverride-46">Clostridium haemolyticum</span> from producing botulism neurotoxin. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;For botulism [to form], you have to make a couple of mistakes. You’ve got to make your haylage a little too wet, [which causes] <span class="CharOverride-46">Clostridium butyricum</span> [to] come in. If you’re feeding all sorts of Roundup corn and Roundup silage, well then, “Boom.” You get this toxico-infectious botulism. It’s even worse than the old botulism that our experts know about, [which happens] when you have a dead critter in the pit silo and you grind it up in the feed and you lose half your herd all at once. That’s not what I’m seeing. What I’m seeing is a few dying, just picking at them. It’s an ongoing problem because they’re producing the neurotoxin in their intestinal tract. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;Monika Krüger developed some test kits [which would detect this problem] that I tried to get over here. She was willing to get them over here. Because [currently] in the U.S., the only way we have to diagnose botulism is you send your tissues [to a vet school for forwarding to a laboratory. Here, we send tissues to] Iowa State or the <a href="">University of Wisconsin vet school</a> <span class="CharOverride-3">(</span>https://www.vetmed.wisc.edu<span class="CharOverride-3">)</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> </span>and then they send [the samples] up to <a href="">Metabiologics</a> <span class="CharOverride-3">(</span>http://www.metabiologics.com<span class="CharOverride-3">) </span>in Madison, Wisconsin, that makes botox, because they have a mouse colony and they inject the mice. If the mice die, you have it. Well, the problem is that the cattle, horses, pigs, wild pigeons that I’ve seen it in—they are all more sensitive than mice. So, when we get this real low level, we can’t confirm it. And in modern medicine…. [when you diagnose lockjaw in livestock, it’s caused by] <span class="CharOverride-46">Clostridium tetani</span>, they get stiff as a board after a castration infection. Nobody ever diagnoses [that] by culturing <span class="CharOverride-46">Clostridium tetani</span>, though. It’s next to impossible to grow. Nobody diagnoses it by finding the neurotoxins, because it’s in parts per <span class="CharOverride-46">trillion</span>, and they can’t find it. Well, botulism is the same way, basically. And yet, you can send them pictures of the cows with their tongues hanging out and drinking like cats. So, I can diagnose it clinically, but I can’t prove it in a lab. And in modern veterinary medicine and in modern human medicine, if you can’t prove it in a lab, it doesn’t exist.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;[And here’s another thing]: it only takes maybe one tenth of one part per million [of glyphosate] to kill <span class="CharOverride-46">Lactobacillus acidophilus</span> and <span class="CharOverride-46">Bifidobacterium bifidum</span>, two real important bugs in the bee’s crop. I’m so disgusted there, because everybody’s leaving glyphosate out of [the colony collapse conversation]. They’re talking about the [neonicotinoid pesticides] that are coating the seeds—yes, they’re part of it. But, if you throw glyphosate into the mix, the bees basically are getting these mites and this Colony Collapse Disorder because they’re starving to death. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;See, they’re like a cow. The cow’s rumen is kind of like the community of soil organisms around a plant’s roots—a big fermentation vat. And so, [when glyphosate is] in there, it’s like any other antibiotic, it sort of screws things up! And we’re trying to ignore it. [The] GMO people are saying “Art, oh, you’re full of [it] because we’ve been feeding it and we see nothing.” Well, that isn’t really science. They’ve never done any side-by-side comparisons. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> So, let’s go back to the effects on humans. Can you talk about the linkage between glyphosate and human disorders?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Well, here’s [a little background first.] If you get involved in medicine, the pharmaceutical companies and the ag chemical companies, everybody is all hooked up together. And it’s just hard to do any out-of-the-box thinking. Dr. Stephanie Seneff<span class="CharOverride-47">10</span>—she just retired, but she was the head of the artificial intelligence division at MIT. I think she’s got a grandchild or somebody with autism. She got all these biology degrees before she went into artificial intelligence. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;So, anyway…Huber got invited to talk at the same meeting that Dr. Seneff got invited to talk at. And she’s known for a long time that there had to be something that we’re eating or that is in our environment that’s helping cause autism. And she listened to Huber and it’s just “Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding!!”</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;[Then there’s] Nancy Swanson<span class="CharOverride-47">11</span>; she was a biophysicist for our Navy. She lives in the state of Washington. She’s part of a lawsuit<span class="CharOverride-47">12</span> out there. Monsanto labeled her, “just a kook.” [That’s] far from true. [If] you look at things that are connected with the science that we know about glyphosate, and [in addition to the disorders already mentioned], look at Type Two Diabetes, it fits in there. Alzheimer’s, Parkinsonism, pancreatic cancer—some fit and some of them don’t. Anyway, when Nancy Swanson gets all the [Centers for Disease Control] data and then looks at these correlations<span class="CharOverride-47">13</span>, and the increase in glyphosate use since 1996 and ’98? Most of them are 97 percent plus! And, if you look at low-density lipoprotein or bad cholesterol supposedly, and Coronary Arterial Disease, I think the correlation is 62 percent. Yes, we need more science, but we’ve refused to even look at it! </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> And Monsanto’s doing whatever they can to stop the research?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Sure, they are! They bought up most of the bee research firms that back up what I said about bees<span class="CharOverride-47">14</span>….</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;[Then there’s] gluten intolerance. [By continuing to use glyphosate on crops] we’re changing the bacterial flora in our gut, and then we get leaky bowel. Then the gluten, instead of getting digested in your intestine, it leaks into your system. So, it’s like a kid that gets stung by a bunch of bees when he’s little. Then he gets allergic. See, you want the wheat to get digested in your bowel and not get into your system. Once it leaks into your system, even if you get the glyphosate out of your diet, if you stimulate your immune system enough and get allergic to it, you’re going to be allergic to it forever! </p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">W</span><span class="CharOverride-4">hile glyphosate’s alleged effects on plants and animals take center stage in many minds, there are also concerns about the chemical’s possible effects—through its antibiotic action—on the health of the soil’s biome. There are fears that long-term application of glyphosate to croplands is leading to the degradation of soil’s load of organic matter, its susceptibility to erosion, and its ability to store carbon. If the soil’s ability to sequester carbon is degraded, this in turn contributes to the worsening of global warming. Art Dunham spoke about these effects at length.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk: </span>You mentioned soil effects earlier. Could you say more about that? </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Today…we’ve got everybody believing that no-till and minimum-till agriculture are way better for soil. And [it’s true that], now that farms are bigger, you can’t mold board plow 640 acres, [because] you’d have all sorts of erosion. [But] of course, everybody that no-tills and minimum-tills has to use glyphosate [to keep the weeds down]. And so, remember that glyphosate is an antibiotic—it’s breaking down the soil organisms that form the aggregation [clumps of soil particles that are held together by moist clay, organic matter (like roots), gums (from bacteria and fungi) and by (fungus filaments)]<span class="CharOverride-47">15</span>, [and that means our] soil organic matter levels are going in the toilet. They’re going down to two percent. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;Francis Thicke<span class="CharOverride-47">16</span>. He knows what he’s talking about. I got this from him first. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> He’s a dairy farmer in Fairfield. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> But he’s also a Ph.D. and was a USDA soil scientist. So, I got this from him and then I double checked it. I’m sure it’s correct. In Iowa, we’ve got all sorts of soil, but [in aggregate] it’s the best soil in the world, and we’re down to three [percent organic matter] and under. If it’s two percent or under it can only hold a half inch of rain an hour. If you gain two percent on that, you can hold another 6 to 8 inches an hour! If every farmer in the world… would raise their soil organic matter by two percent…</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> …that would have a positive effect on soil loss and erosion. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> [With Roundup Ready seed and the attendant application of glyphosate] you don’t get to store that much carbon below the ground, so you’re lucky if you hold your organic matter and keep from losing it. [If you were growing] non-treated corn [and not applying glyphosate and killing the microbes in the soil], you could raise your soil organic matter by 30 tons [per acre] below the ground. [You could] raise your organic matter by half a percent per year. And, if every farmer in the world raised their organic matter by two percent, you not only hold more water for both flood situations and drought, you would store an amount of carbon equivalent to all the carbon dioxide generated by mankind in the last one hundred years. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> The implication is that glyphosate is playing a part in climate change. One last question: Are there any countries which haven’t approved glyphosate for agricultural use?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Uh, practically everybody’s approved it at one time or another. [But] Sri Lanka has outlawed it because they’ve had so many people with renal failure—people in their 20s and 30s, and they don’t have hospitalization as adequate as us and they have no money, so they’re dying. So, Sri Lanka is the bravest country in the world right now</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs">&#9;&#9;And then there’s Germany. Germany [was] the first major nation [to put restrictions in place]. [Because] Germany outlawed [glyphosate’s use in] all spray-drying of crops for human and animal use. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-45">Rootstalk:</span> What moved them to do that?</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Interview-Paragraphs"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dunham:</span> Well, the main reason they did it is because, well, you can’t efficiently brew beer [with glyphosate-finished grain]. See, the barley farmers started to spray-dry the crop [with glyphosate] and then they didn’t tell the breweries they were doing that. And then the breweries were having a harder time brewing their beer. [They decided the antibiotic effect is] for real, so they’ve got to go back to windrowing [the barley crop] and letting it sun-dry.</p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Bios"><span class="CharOverride-11">Thomas Agran</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> (http://thomasagran.com/home.html) was born in Stanford, Kentucky, but grew up across the river in Cincinnati, Ohio. He fell for Iowa while studying art at Grinnell College (https://www.grinnell.edu), before later attending Indiana University to pursue an MFA in Painting (https://soaad.indiana.edu/academics/graduate/mfa.html). Agran lives with his family in Iowa City, Iowa, working as a practicing artist, a teacher, and Director of Public Art for the Iowa City Downtown District (http://downtowniowacity.com).</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Bios"><span class="CharOverride-12">     Concerning the work in his “Development Potential” series, which we’re featuring in this issue, Agran says: “Commuting back and forth to Cedar Rapids, I often turned off the interstate in North Liberty to take a quick spin through farmland on my way back to Iowa City. A new high school condemned that last patch of farmland to development</span><span class="CharOverride-49">—</span><span class="CharOverride-12">the definition of “pioneering sprawl”</span><span class="CharOverride-49">—</span><span class="CharOverride-12">and I watched as a favorite farmstead was razed to the ground. The subsequent reformatting of the land has been seductively dramatic, and this fall I created work responding to the uncompromising destruction and contextless reconstruction of Scanlon Farm into Scanlon Farms North Ridge. The land was ripped open, pushed around, rebuilt, and then sutured together with black erosion fence, creating a sterilized and entirely unrecognizable topography. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Bios"><span class="CharOverride-12">     “I approached my work with a similar mindset, creating paintings and drawings with a process informed by the same forceful and aggressive handling of the landscape. Working on site, I sought to capture the expansive and spectacular landscapes that would often appear and disappear in the course of an afternoon. I approached larger studio works with the same kind of additive and subtractive energy and force [which] I watched edit that once-pastoral part of my drive. The resulting drawings and paintings depict a dramatic, transitional landscape of false geologic scale, scattered with the arbitrary punctuations of surveying flags and sewage mains.”</span></p>

On almost 50 acres of forest, each branch of each tree was loaded with layer upon layer of butterflies. Over the next 20 years, the size of the overwintering colonies fluctuated widely around a mean of six hectares. Then in the mid-2000s the colonies began to shrink, hitting an all-time low of 0.67 hectare (1.6 acres, less than the size of a city block) in the winter of 2013-14. </span></p>

Here generations two and three would quickly grow, mate, lay eggs and die within six to ten weeks, building up population numbers.

However, in the winter of 2012-13, wildlife biologists finally stopped watching and sounded the alarm when the number of monarchs overwintering in Mexico reached an all-time low, with the entire population fitting into fewer than two acres.

A decision to put monarchs on the threatened species list would have vast repercussions. It would become illegal to harm the species in any way, including through harm to its habitat. Common land management actions, such as mowing or grazing at the wrong time, or converting a conservation area back to row crops, could trigger a fine.

It favors two main changes in agricultural practices for the upper Midwest. The first is the (modernized) return of integrated crop-livestock systems with grazing by ruminants and long (four or more year) crop rotations that require little or no herbicide or nitrogen inputs and result in more perennial vegetation in the ground at any given time. The second change would be planting 10 percent of fields with 30-foot-wide strips of tallgrass prairie wrapped around the contour of the slope.

The Tallgrass Prairie Center is investigating seed mixes and systems for assuring appropriate species and sources of seeds that will deliver diverse ecosystem services while controlling costs. </span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">he fate of the monarch butterfly is linked to every other conservation issue associated with industrial agriculture in the Midwest. If we continue to avoid an honest reckoning, the monarch will fare no better than grassland nesting birds, our rivers and drinking water supplies, rural communities, or the Gulf of Mexico. These sacrifices were not inevitable and can be reversed. The widespread popularity of the monarch butterfly presents us with an unprecedented opportunity to welcome a new group of urban advocates for farm and food policy that, in line with Aldo Leopold’s vision, “changes the role of </span><span class="CharOverride-4">Homo sapiens</span><span class="CharOverride-3"> from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it”. (1949) Like any true community, what benefits one member, ultimately benefits us all. Saving the monarch migration will require us to convert large areas of row crops back to diverse perennial grassland, and this will have uncounted benefits for soil, water, biodiversity; that is the ecosystem as a whole. </span></p>

She told me about a boy she fancied and swore me to secrecy on the day she left the chicken coop open and the coon got in. We even had this idea of getting married on the same day, but when I got engaged, Louise was still only fourteen and her mother wasn’t about to let her pick a man when there were so many other children in the house who needed caring after and the family butcher shop in need of sweeping.</span></p>

I told her about the man who had written a letter to me in secret. “Of course I burned it in the stove,” I said. She nodded. We started our affairs within the month.

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-3">The Downy Woodpecker is a common sight across North America all year round on tree branches and trunks or tall weeds and grasses. Both males and females have checkered black and white wings, but only the males have a patch of red feathers on the top of their head. Keep an eye out for them in the prairie and near open woodlands, particularly deciduous trees.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-8">Song</span><span class="CharOverride-3">: The Downy Woodpecker’s whinnying call, made by both sexes, is a typical sound of deciduous forests during the breeding season, along with drumming noises they make with their beaks to claim territories and attract mates. It’s a somewhat excited string of hoarse, high-pitched notes that descend in pitch toward the end; the call lasts about two seconds. Excited birds also give a very sharp </span><span class="CharOverride-4">pik</span><span class="CharOverride-3"> note, occasionally repeated several times.

It arrived this morning, and when I signed for it, I gave the guy from English Classics some money to put it upstairs by the big window in the study. You may have your own ideas about where it should go, of course. I think it’s a good spot, even though there’s nothing else in here, except the tall wooden hat rack you haven’t found a place for yet. I’ve opened the window to the breeze that ruffles these pages and chills the room. I can just make out the blue ocean through the elms. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">’ve got your old photo album with me. It’s weird, different from everything else in this place. Its creamy white is a desperate stab at formality, betrayed by its cheap vinyl construction, as if there were a market for wedding albums you could buy off the bargain table at Walgreens. It’s cracked with age and ragged from years of handling, but I can see how the biting irony of it would have made you laugh. I hadn’t thought about it before, but this old album might say more about who you used to be than anything pressed inside.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3"> </span><span class="CharOverride-3">I’m writing this in the Jenni Bick Journal you bought me. Now and then, I stop and run my fingers over my debossed initials hammered into its spine. The journal is more like everything else in your house: ornate, meticulously hand-crafted, and expensive. It would be great to believe I’m a lot like this journal: handsome and well-made, but it’s just not so.</span></p>

I don’t think it was a mistake and I’ve got no regrets about it. You may feel differently, but when you think about it maybe you’ll see this is for the best.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">was so happy when you found me. Your voice over the phone sounded just like it had twenty years ago, light and wry all at once, like laughter at the end of the world. You were exactly who I needed to hear, exactly what I wanted, and we burnt whole nights on the phone long-distance.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">F</span><span class="CharOverride-3">or all that time spent, our talks didn’t include much catching up. It had been so long since we’d seen each other, but we rode roughshod over those intervening years. You told me you were a CPA now, and that you had a big house on Wishart. I remembered that crummy ground floor apartment you lived in with your mom and figured that had to feel really good. I told you I had drifted around after the Army, headed west doing this and that over the years. I told you I had done some work with horses.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">“</span><span class="CharOverride-3">Oh, I love horses!” you said, the way everyone who’s never mucked a stable or been thrown says they love horses. “I can’t imagine you working on a ranch. You were always the smart one; I thought you’d be writing your fifth book of poems by now.”</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">“</span><span class="CharOverride-3">I never got around to writing my first one.”</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">didn’t tell you that I had been pretty serious about horses. After the Army, I moved around north Texas as a stable hand, then a wrangler, for years before I landed a trainer’s position at a ranch in Kansas. I didn’t tell you how I got hurt pretty bad. I was getting this Friesian ready for the ring. I worked mostly barrel horses; dressage was not my strong suit. But Manny, the guy who ran the stable, put in a good word for me. Besides, Friesians are usually gentle and I thought we got along. I always thought I was good with horses, that I had a knack for it, but maybe I wasn’t ready. Maybe I spooked her, I don’t know. While I was in the stable, yarning her mane, she pressed me against the wall, pressed me hard. Broke three of my ribs and ruptured my L1 and L2 disks, just like that. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">didn’t tell you that the year before you found me I was living on disability and using up my unemployment. I was renting a shitty efficiency on the east side of Wichita, where I moved as little as possible while I ate OxyContin and tried to figure out what to do next. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">t didn’t feel like I was holding out on you; you didn’t seem to want to hear about any of that anyway. You were more interested in who we were when we met, who we said we were going to be back then, and I went with it. Truth is that the accident and a year on my back had left me rattled, like I really wasn’t cut out for horses, or much of anything else. I was still passing time reading a lot; that hadn’t changed since we were together. It felt good to stop thinking about the present. It felt good to think maybe it was never too late to write a book of poems.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">Y</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ou were always drilling me about our time together, our friends, the way things were back then. “Do you remember Jason and Anna?” you asked. “Do you remember the Owl Creek Diner?” “Do you remember how we met?”</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">W</span><span class="CharOverride-3">e met on the shore of Virginia Beach, by Lynnhaven pier, the winter after high school. There was a party, lots of people. I remember seeing you dance to The Pixies around the towering bonfire. The rest of us didn’t know who The Pixies were. My friends talking big and hitting on you, getting shot down one by one. I remember finally stepping up and asking if I could dance near you, and your friends laughing and you smiling and shrugging an indifferent “yes.” We never took our eyes off each other.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">L</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ater, when the hot fire was too much, you grabbed a bottle of wine with one hand and my hand in your other and we ran off into the dark. I remember the cold sky and the brittle starlight, the restless surf’s endless crashing, and the way you drew close to my ear to be heard. I </span>listened to<span class="CharOverride-3"> all the smart things you said and I remember the curves of your bare body pressed against my own. I remembered giving you my long wool coat and walking back slow, hand in hand, back to the light and the heat and our friends surrounding.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">W</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hat I didn’t tell you, what I’ve been thinking about this past week, is how easy it all was back then. Whenever we moved we were dancing. We talked and we knew our words were smart. Whatever we looked at was beautiful, and we looked at each other. The very best thing I remember about that year we spent together was how inevitable everything was, how naturally our pleasures came to us, how little we had to really think about anything. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">“</span><span class="CharOverride-3">Remember the poem you wrote me?” you asked. I remember the night I left for boot camp, I wrote you a poem and left it in your windowsill. It said something about how hard it was to leave, but that I had to go see the world. I remember it said something about wanting to go find something worth remembering, worth writing down. I remember that I wanted you to know I was going to miss you and wouldn’t forget you. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">“</span><span class="CharOverride-3">Of course I remember,” I told you, but the honest truth is that I couldn’t remember any of the exact words I’d written.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3"> </span><span class="CharOverride-3">I told you I’d never been married, got close a couple times. You told me you’d just been through a long, messy divorce, and now that it was over I was on your mind a lot. You found me on the internet, and there we were.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">’m telling you all of this so you’ll understand how much I appreciate your invitation after all those years. How good it felt to throw some clothes and a few books into a duffle bag and catch the next Greyhound for Virginia. Packed in tight with everyone headed east, I watched some big windmills churning in the dark outside of Hope and wondered what it’d be like to just start over with you, to finally be the poet I had set out to be all those years ago. I wondered why I’d given it up, why I’d never found much worth writing down or remembering. I want you to know that above everything else, I’m grateful.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">still have that selfie you took at the bus stop, first thing. The moons of our faces pressed close. Mine waning and grizzled from the road, yours beaming and bright-eyed. It’s still on my phone; I look at it all the time. It’s good to see on our faces the optimism we were capable of, to remind myself that as beat up as I am, it’s still possible to feel that good. I hadn’t felt that good since I could remember, and I’m sorry to say I haven’t felt that good since. Fresh starts are always best before you actually get started. I see that now.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">here were other good moments like that. I don’t want you to think it was all bad. I don’t know when it turned. Maybe the bad had been there since the beginning, just hidden under all the nights we stayed up late, making love and binge-watching shows I hadn’t seen but you told me I had to. Maybe the bad was just under the blue horizon every weekend we caught the Number Six bus out to Neptune’s Park, just waiting for us to turn our backs on the ocean so it could creep in on the tide and find us. I don’t know why, but things changed. This fresh start, for all of those good moments we shared, has stalled, and I’m leaving. You deserve to know why, know all the things I can’t keep to myself anymore.</span></p>

I don’t know if the years have worn on the house or on me, but it looks now like a sagging pile of bricks, with a busted foundation and floors warped and twisted into waves of cherrywood, dull and scratched. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">E</span><span class="CharOverride-3">very night before bed, like a ritual, you wander the dusty upstairs, bemoaning every new crack in the plaster like some kind of fairytale banshee. La Llorona, issuing a forlorn tirade against the plumbers and roofers and carpenters, the HVAC specialists, and the masons, all coming to overcharge you, to rip you off and take away everything you’ve fought so hard to make for yourself. So you never call any of them to fix any of it, and the cracks fan out and deepen, the wood rots, the pipes drip faster, and your nightly inventories go on.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3"> </span><span class="CharOverride-3">For as well as you have done for yourself, the years had not been kind to you, either. I see that now, too. You work too hard and too long. You come home every night exhausted and complaining about nuances of accounting that I don’t really understand, clients that I’ll never meet, bills I could never afford to pay for things I don’t think I’d ever want. You make more money than I ever will, but it’s not making you any richer. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">   </span><span class="CharOverride-3">On your days off you never want to do anything except Facebook and Instagram and shop online. I’ve never seen you read anything except the catalogs that come in the mail alongside the Amazon boxes that pile up every day on your gingerbread porch. Catalogs chock-full of Victorian candleholders and Betty Boop toilet covers, pizza cutters from Norway and wine from Costa Rica. The catalogs pile up in drifts on every table and on every shelf, burying the little stack of books I brought with me. I look at them, worn and dog-eared, and can’t help feel they deserve better. Between the nightly complaints about work and the nightly complaints about some new dent in the wainscoting, there is a time in which you open your boxes and post selfies with whatever new thing you have now. I watch you beam into your smartphone and leave you alone. These are your finest hours.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">t’s not just you. I want you to know that I’m not proud of the way I’ve carried on, either. I tell you I’m writing; I tell you my ideas for poems. The truth is I haven’t written anything. Those ideas are just from other people’s poems I’ve read. While you’re at work, I take long walks and try to come up with my own. I walk huge orbits around your neighborhood, as far out as the Wolfsnare. I watch the leaves change and the sun get lower. I come home when my back starts to hurt; I bring the catalogs and boxes in from your porch. Other than that, I stare at the blank pages of the leather-bound notebook you bought me and wish I had an OxyContin. I sign for the odd delivery that arrives late and wait for you to come home.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">have terrible dreams. I’m back in Kansas in that stable and I can’t move and that Friesian’s eye is so close to my face it’s an obsidian marble set in a field of glossy black hair. There’s no anger, not even fear, only love in the white of it. Then she crushes me against the wall and my ribs crack inside my chest and I feel my back wrench and the vertebrae pop. It sounds like a controlled, three-round burst of rifle fire. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">wake up beside you in your big feather bed and I can’t breathe. I lay there in the dark and wonder how something can love you and hurt you terribly and it’s the rightest thing you can imagine. I lay next to you, listen to you while you growl in your sleep. Sometimes you flail your arms and kick and laugh out loud. When it looks like the sun’s about to rise, I go down and make us breakfast. When you come down I ask about how you slept. You tell me you slept fine. You tell me you don’t remember your dreams.</span></p>

You produced from the back of an upstairs closet your photo album, and from among your old photos you showed me a worn and yellow scrap of paper tucked into a stationary envelope stapled to the thick, black page. You removed it and handed it to me so carefully. “Don’t tear it.” </span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">am certain now that the poem I gave you all those years ago was the most pretentious, bombastic, clichéd, and malformed thing I’ve ever read. I mean that honestly without exaggeration. The goddamn worst thing. All the crap that passed for wisdom from a smug, know-it-all punk kid who didn’t know anything about anything at all. A poem from before he’d “seen the world,” and been awarded a medal for looking right into the eye of and then killing a kid younger than he was when he wrote it. Before he’d drunk, popped, and snorted his way out of the service. A poem from before the years of wasted stupor that followed, before he met Manny, who gave him a break and a job, and before he finally found something kind to him, something good in living beside great and graceful animals. Before that goddamn Friesian and whatever was wrong with her that day took it all away from me.</span></p>

Like some old Japanese soldier proudly defending your atoll decades after your emperor threw in the towel. The truth is I was embarrassed for us both.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">“</span><span class="CharOverride-3">That’s really something,” I said, and carefully folded up that old paper and gave it back.

He’s in Nebraska now, heads a ranch, said he needed a wrangler with some experience. When he said of course he remembered me and asked if I was interested, I didn’t ask for any details. I don’t care if it pays bad or its back to mucking horseshit and hauling hay bales. I’ll do it ‘til my back gives out for good and I drop. There are worse fates; I see that now.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">F</span><span class="CharOverride-3">or two weeks this past summer, I had a farm of my very own.  This is the story of what those weeks were like for me: my everyday routine, its trials, and my growth.  A family that I babysit for in the small town of Grinnell, Iowa, went away on vacation for two weeks and asked me to take care of their house while they were gone.  It’s on a hill outside of town that includes acres of land in the back, a small barn with goats, dogs and cats, and a chicken coop.  Chores such as milking the goats at 5 a.m. required that I live there and use their car to commute to my full-time job.  In addition to being paid, I was allowed to use their kitchen, their bed, and utilities.  As a bonus, I got a glimpse into what life on a small Midwestern farm is like.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hese surroundings were quite different from what I had known from the suburban streets of my hometown, San Jose, California.  My backyard at home is relatively large for its neighborhood.  It covers two of the house’s four sides; the third faces the front yard, and the final serves as a passageway from one yard to another.  I’d always thought of myself as fortunate to be able to be outside with grass, a garden, and a play structure.  But if I had grown up with the farm’s 115 acres, I would have felt like a king in his spread of the world.  Whole days would have been filled up by the scenes I discovered there: a stream with a steep bank, woodland areas, and of course the tall grasses of the meadows. There was an open hill on the property from which I could see the house as a tiny box from afar.  From one spot in the fence line, I could even look between two framing oak trees, across the highway and straight across miles of open countryside.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">n standout moments I could imagine my friends from home calling me a farm girl, had they been able to see what I was doing.  The first time this happened was on the second day I was there, in the backyard.  I was exploring the grounds with Herb, one of the family’s three Anatolian Shepherd dogs (the others were Peaches and Rosie).  As I explored the variety of unknown weeds and wildlife, Herb was sometimes leading and sometimes following, sometimes going off on his own, but always returning, even when I thought he had gone too far and wouldn’t be able to find me.  I ran with Herb through a hill of prairie grass—literally frolicking.  I had always wanted to frolic through rolling green hills, “Sound of Music” style, but I had never realized how enjoyable it would be to push back grass taller than myself, or to leap through it like I was wading in the tide.  Here, with Herb’s tonguey smile beside me as we ran, I thought of how fun and different it might have been to grow up in this place instead of in California.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hough I may have been more entertained in this alternate upbringing, I would also have taken more hits from nature.  While I was exploring the massive space, I was wearing a skirt, not pants.  The vegetation, while fun to explore in parts, also scraped me up pretty well with thorns, spikes, sticks and brambles, and spotted me with bites from mosquitoes and other mystery insects.  Navigating got frustrating and tiresome, especially when I was hungry and still a good fifteen minutes out from the house without a clear notion of how to get there.  When I finally got back, my camera was covered in dust and my legs in red blotches and marks. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">A </span><span class="CharOverride-3">second farm-girl moment materialized in the kitchen.  The kitchen was where I spent most of my waking hours, taking advantage of having the whole place to myself to cook meals, try new things, mess it all up and clean it when I got around to it.  Cooking dinner one night, I realized that it was the first time that I had ever constructed a meal off of such intimately local ingredients.  The only things I had bought were the vegetables.  The eggs, the milk, and the bread that I had baked had all come from the farm.  It was a learning moment not only of taste, but also of economics.  I was proud that I had saved the money that would have gone into store-bought proteins and grains, but I was also aware, on a personal level, of the self-sufficiency that farming makes possible.  I could visualize a lifestyle sustained not by monetary currency, but by the fruits  of investing in land and livestock, as humans had done for thousands of years.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">C</span><span class="CharOverride-3">aring for the animals was a growing experience, putting me in the mind of the “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” training sequence from the Disney movie Mulan—except that I wouldn’t say that I overcame anyone in the end to become an expert in the field of milk-maidery.  The morning and afternoon milkings were a tussle at first, with the goats stamping in irritation as I tried to adjust my technique.  Milking one teat at a time was easier for me because I could hold on to the bucket, but milking both in a rhythm went faster and seemed to be more pleasant for the goats.  One of the goats, Dolly, only produced milk in one udder and she would kick and make a fuss before I even touched her.  Of the five goats I milked, some consistently made it easier than others, and some I consistently dealt with last.  Luckily, kicks to the bucket usually resulted only in sloshes lost over the top, but occasionally the whole bucket would tumble over and make a pond of milk on the floor for the dogs to drink.  </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">W</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hen that happened—and it seemed to happen in succession because the female goats (or does) waiting in the pen would see it and get a similar idea—I would react in various ways.  Sometimes I would groan or shout.  Other times I’d just keep milking as if nothing had happened.  The lack of milk was to their own detriment as it was fed to the kids in the adjacent pen, and I never understood why the goats would want to knock the bucket over, subjecting their own offspring to hunger.  Still, I knew that the kids would always have enough, either supplemented by pellets or from the yard outside. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">P</span><span class="CharOverride-3">art of why I milked was also to relieve these girls of their uncomfortable weights.  As time went on, I started observing how the more their udders bulged the funnier they would walk,   and I began to feel more sorry for them than upset when they kicked.  Especially when the older goats like Naomi and Dolly winced, I thought about how I would feel if some young inexperienced person was hurting the most sensitive part of my body.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">A</span><span class="CharOverride-3">fter milking a goat I’d lead her out the back door by the collar.  I got into the habit of saying, “Thank you, Miss Naomi.”  Sometimes the sentiment was sincere, and other times I hoped that my showing civility would reward me with a better experience next time.  “Next time” was a given, because I couldn’t leave any of them unmilked or unfed.  It was more than merely a chore, in that I was responsible for their lives no matter how hard it was for me to get out of bed some  mornings at 5:00 a.m.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">he most difficult task I had in the barn, and the thing that would make me dread coming in the next time, was corralling.  The goats, understandably trapped and wanting access to food and the run of the barn, would be clever and find ways to butt out when I opened the pens.  One doe in particular had an iron neck and determination and would shove the others out of the way to be the first out of the gate, causing the others to rush the gate and burst free.  The does weren’t as bad as the bucks, because I could lead them back by the collar even if the strong-necked one went dead-weight on me.  The bucks, huge and stir-crazy, were horrendous.  Lugging them in the right direction was hard enough, let alone getting them into their pen.  As soon as I’d open the door to put one back in, another would go out again.  In fact, a jailbreak would often ensue just as I was putting the last one back, making me repeat the process upwards of three times.  One time I stood amidst their heads shoved down different feed bags and wondered how bad it would be if I just left them there.  Putting them back didn’t seem like a possibility.  But somehow I would do it, yelling and panting and picking up the last little one, Lamb-of-God style, to lower him into the pen from above the gate.  By this time, I would be physically exhausted and able only to trudge back up the hill to the house.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3"> </span><span class="CharOverride-3">One night that I’d had to wrangle the goats back inside, I banged my head hard on the top of the baby pen door just as I finished, and I immediately burst into tears.  It was a good, healthy cry, something I hadn’t had in months, and all three dogs came up to the pen to comfort me.  That was a new experience for me too; I had seen movies and read books where the dogs could sense suffering and come in times of need, but my little shih-tzu-poodle mix back home in California had never done anything like that.  Here were three dogs, a family, that enjoyed playing together and resting together in the evenings, that wouldn’t hesitate to come up to me wanting some affection, would forgive me for my having to sometimes push them in the pens to prevent goats from coming out, and were there for me when I felt unappreciated.  I stood there on the fence for awhile sniffling and petting their faces, moved with love from their kisses.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">F</span><span class="CharOverride-3">rom there on, my tasks got steadily easier.  Feeding the baby goats was fun because they’d drink the milk in a frenzy.  They anticipated mealtimes aggressively and would jump on me when I entered the pen.  I confess I felt favoritism for Spring, the littlest of the kids.  She was black with light brown spots by her eyes, and she drank kneeling on the ground with her front legs tucked into the hay and her hind legs tall, tail wagging, eyes half-closed.  She slurped without pausing to take a breath, leaving her coughing and burping afterwards.  I don’t think I ever loved anything the way she loved milk.  Her calling in anticipation of mealtime was distinctive all the way from the house.  </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">he kittens held another special place in my heart.  I was shocked at how quickly they grew: on the first day, they shied away from being picked up and let out intermittent cries for their mama.  Apart from napping, their time was spent demurely swiping at one another’s tails or tussling together.  But within two weeks, they had grown into tall and lean almost-cats. They could spring up the walls of their cage in pursuit of a piece of hay, wrestle one another all around the boundaries of their cage, and jump into my hand when I came to give them food.  An all-black kitten I called Jackie wasn’t afraid of anything and was quite the escape artist.  She scared me to death when she once threatened to go into the great outdoors with the goats.  In calmer times she would let me cradle her in my arms and would climb onto my shoulder.  Mama Emily was the classic couldn’t-care-less mother who lounged the day away and folded over like a string if I picked her up.  </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hen there were the chickens to tend to, who invariably squawked in unison and flew for their lives if they heard a suspicious sound.  To collect eggs, I had to hunch over with my bucket and creep to every corner of the chicken coop.  I’d collect six or seven eggs a day, far more than I would eat by myself, and became absolutely inundated with them.  Eggs came to the forefront of every meal: hard-boiled, scrambled, fried or baked in a quiche.  Sometimes my meals would start at 9:00 p.m. and end with me going to bed.  There were times, though, when I had a couple of hours to read my book in the living room, where I could watch the last bit of sunlight leave the sky.  </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">C</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ooking, showering and reading were the only times I had for myself.  It was peaceful at the house; I could say whatever I wanted, sing whenever I wanted, wear whatever I wanted and just lounge around for hours on weekends.  I was able to live as I had when I was a kid, caring nothing about my appearance, and simply wearing whatever was dry and clean.  Large t-shirts and athletic shorts became my everyday attire. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">B</span><span class="CharOverride-3">eing at the farm also gave me a deeper understanding of the Iowa prairie.  I knew what it meant when people wrote that the fields made waves like the sea, because I could see them rippling and glinting in the wind when I drove to the house.  I was able to read poems about the prairie grasses while sitting in the middle of them.  Reading about the love for the sunsets and the changing seasons of the Midwest made more sense to me the more I became integrated into the Grinnell community and came to understand a landscape that differed from my native one.  </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">viscerally miss the beach when I see photos of it, my family’s voices when I hear them over the phone, and the California warmth when I check the weather, but I never regretted my time at the farm.  I experienced something on my own, and I gained insight into the life of a farmer and a Midwesterner that can’t be understood by words alone.  Tired, cranky, and busy as I was at times, I valued the work I did because I could see its impact on the animals around me.  From them, I learned more than I have from humans about how to embody emotion.  Under a huge Iowa sky, and surrounded by trees on all sides, with only the sounds of the braying of animals and intermittent breezes, work done and doing nothing, I was happy.  </span></p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-3">The little gray Tufted Titmouse is common in eastern deciduous forests and a frequent visitor to feeders. The large black eyes, small, round bill, and brushy crest gives these birds a quiet but eager expression that matches the way they flit through canopies, hang from twig-ends, and drop in to bird feeders. When a titmouse finds a large seed, you’ll see it carry the prize to a perch and crack it with sharp whacks of its stout bill. Tufted Titmice are acrobatic foragers, if a bit slower and more methodical than chickadees. They often flock with chickadees, nuthatches, and woodpeckers and are regular visitors to feeders, where they are assertive over smaller birds. Their flight tends to be fluttery but level rather than undulating.You’ll find Tufted Titmice in most eastern woodlands below 2,000 feet of elevation, including </span><span class="CharOverride-3">deciduous and evergreen forests. Tufted Titmice are also common visitors at feeders and can be found in backyards, parks, and orchards.</span></p>

It is a tale of mistakes made and made again, of experiments with exotic plants and strange substances and foolish choices—and serious addiction. This is a ballad of unnatural behavior and of lost roots, but more than anything else, it’s the story of an approach to a long-sought goal: Nirvana. This is the story of how I found grass: pleasure in grass, euphoria in grass, contentment in grass.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">n the early spring of 1976 I, along with a number of my Grinnell College colleagues, received a mimeographed sheet of paper by campus mail on which was an appealing description of a parcel of land that was being offered for sale. The sellers, members of the Department of Sociology, were moving to California; the land was located about 12 miles south of town. The flyer spoke of coreopsis and chipmunks, columbine and chickadees. Intrigued, my wife and I went out to have a look on what must have been the final day of that spring’s thaw. The fact that the ground we sought was accessible only through a quarter mile of naked bean field on the north or a greasy minimum maintenance road from the south presented us with our first challenge. We knew that trying to drive would be sheer folly, so we rolled up our trousers and slipped and slogged through several hundred yards of mud, reaching the property line with about 10 pounds of Iowa gumbo on each boot. Then we walked across the cornfield to the edge of the timber, stopped and listened to the silence and breathed the air.... we simply looked at each other and nodded. Watching a cock pheasant catapult from a bramble patch, cack-cack-cackling its way across the cornfield like an old biplane hitting on one cylinder certainly put an ear-to-ear grin on my face. Even with the brown muddy field and the leafless trees, we were smitten. Following a short price haggle, and after convincing the folks at the local savings bank that we were reasonable risks, our two names were added to the deed for the NW 1/4 of the SW 1/4 of Section 26, Township 79 North, Range 16 West of the 5th PM. What that meant was 40 acres, exactly square, a quarter-mile on each side, one half scrub timber, second growth oak, hickory, hack berry, silver maple, aspen, and box elder, 12 tillable acres, and 8 acres that looked to me to be just plain scrub.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">was holding down two jobs at that time—teaching at Grinnell College during the school year and running a theatre company in North Carolina during the summers—so it was well into autumn before I began to discover what we had purchased, to learn the gullies and small hills, the branches and shallow frog ponds, and to begin to devise plans for our acquisition’s future. I can’t say exactly what my wife saw that made her agree with me that we needed to buy this ground—virtually worthless by many standards—but I know what I saw. I saw a chance to create for myself a little bit of North Carolina—a piece of my old homeland—in the middle of this land of corn. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">hadn’t been long in the state between two rivers, and I must admit that I still felt like a stranger to the heartland. I missed the red clay hills I had left behind, the pines and hemlocks and the sweet gums. Why couldn’t I transform this little landscape so it would be green in the winter, burn red in the fall, and smell of pine needles all the year round? Ah, the thorny paths the follies of youth can lead us down.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">O</span><span class="CharOverride-3">f course, what I was hoping to do is what settlers in a new land have forever done. From the irrigated green lawns of Phoenix to the rows of blue spruce in Nebraska to the place in the northeast of the U.S. called New England, we humans have always tried to bring home with us, and to recreate it when we arrive in a new and different place. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">S</span><span class="CharOverride-3">o, my initial impulse was unremarkable. The next spring I contacted the state forestry nursery in Ames and ordered a thousand seedlings—Scotch and white pines, spruce and maples. When they arrived I borrowed a planter from our biology department. Calling it a planter is an overstatement; it was a devious piece of iron, weighted and pointed on one end, that was heavy to lift, hurt my hands when I slammed it down, hurt my feet when I shoved it in the ground, and rattled my bones like a minor car crash when I was unlucky enough to hit it into a stone. Nevertheless, I set about circling the cornfield with little 6-to-8 inch sprouts and sticks, heeled them in (as they say in the forestry world), prayed for rain, and headed off to North Carolina for my summer of theatre. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">O</span><span class="CharOverride-3">n my return at the end of the summer, I went anxiously to my new tree farm, expecting at least two feet of new growth, and there, amid lush green grass, and in the shadow of 10-foot-high swaying Iowa corn, were my evergreen trees, exactly the same size I had left them, but a lovely reddish brown in color and as brittle as fine porcelain figurines. The maple sticks were nowhere to be found. It turns out I should have told my renter who was planting the cornfield what I was up to. I learned that seedling trees and the broadleaf weed-killer atrazine—which he had spread on the field—don’t get along.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">U</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ndaunted, I planned for the following spring. This time I would plant a thousand evergreens (after all I had lost a year) plus a few walnut trees and, as a nod to the Midwest and for bird food, some high-bush cranberry. The next May when my planting was completed I limped on my sore feet to the farmer’s house to make sure that he would spray only the middle of the field. Shortly thereafter we packed our things again and headed east. Each time I looked at those gently swaying Carolina pines that summer, I could almost feel my young seedlings growing like reeds, creating a miniature Tar heel state in the middle of Iowa.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">W</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hat I saw that August was indeed remarkable—no swaying pines, no little saplings, no matter how hard I looked. They had been smothered by a twenty-foot border of weeds surrounding the cornfield. The burdock and velvet leaf and jimson weed and ragweed plants, overjoyed by the absence of herbicide, all about 12 feet high, had simply devoured my little babies.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">O</span><span class="CharOverride-3">f course, there was nothing to do but plow ahead. Johnny Appleseed must have had setbacks, I reasoned; Sandy Seedling wasn’t going to let a couple of bad years put him off his course. If my friend on the other side of town could make pine trees grow on his lovely Christmas tree plantation; surely I could too. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">cut back a bit. Just 500 trees, all evergreens, I made a list: </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">1</span><span class="CharOverride-3">. Let the farmer know so he won’t spray. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">2</span><span class="CharOverride-3">. Clip the weeds early. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">3</span><span class="CharOverride-3">. Arrange for another clipping during the&#9;&#9;&#9;summer. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">even carried buckets of water around to give each seedling a drink before I left that May—and that was pretty much the last water they saw all summer. This time when I returned, everything was brown. It was the drought summer—dead weeds, almost dead corn—all curled up, and of course 500 little brown brittle match sticks sadly surrounding it all. Needless to say I was a wee bit disappointed. I was beginning to feel like the Jeffrey Dahmer of the tannenbaum world. I could imagine the little baby trees begging not to be sent to that Moffett guy. Unlike Mr. Christmas tree, I couldn’t get the damn things through one summer.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">t was beginning to look like a change of tactics was in order, so for the next few years I simply let everything alone and enjoyed what was there. To say I decided to do this would be an over-statement. It was more by default, or maybe from exhaustion or a failure of imagination. But we were beginning to spend more summer time in Grinnell, and I was amazed and took pleasure in watching the corn and beans grow before my eyes. I set aside a couple of acres and seeded it to alfalfa and brome (which I realized later were non-native and invasive, but I was ignorant then), enough hay to get our horses through the winter. I laid out half a dozen possible cabin sites and built a small, if somewhat leaky pond. And I began to see things.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">A</span><span class="CharOverride-3">nnie Dillard, in her book </span><span class="CharOverride-4">Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</span><span class="CharOverride-3">, devotes a chapter to seeing—the phenomenon whereby we alert our senses to something in our environment we have never noticed before, and then suddenly begin to find that everywhere. She tells of hiding a penny on a sidewalk when she was young and chalking arrows pointing to it with messages saying “surprise ahead” and “money this way.” Then she would spend the rest of the day imagining the lucky finder with wider eyes looking for pennies and finding many more. Reflecting on this, she says: “It is dire poverty when a man won’t stoop to pick up a penny . . . If you cultivate a healthy poverty and simplicity, so that finding a penny will literally make your day, then, since the world is in fact planted with pennies, you have with your poverty bought a lifetime of days. It is that simple. What you see is what you get.” During the next two summers I began to see those planted pennies.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">saw that my oaks were not simply oaks, but burr oaks and red oaks and pin oaks; that the oaks grew in their own places and the hickories and maples in their separate spots.

And, of course the stately coneflowers; it was the other plants, grasses and sedges, that kept me there, though; each seeming to have its own place, a part in some kind of balance. Changes would happen from month to month and over the next couple of years, but never the sort of change that seemed to destroy anything. There was nothing that appeared to need mowing—nothing to apply chemicals to. </span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">had found grass, and although I still couldn’t identify much of it I was slowly beginning to see grass everywhere—the turkey’s feet of big bluestem, the plumes of Indian grass, the sprays of switch grass in roadside ditches, vacant lots, railroad rights-of-way. Something was taking hold. A dependence was beginning. I made pilgrimages to the spectacular national grasslands in Oklahoma, Wyoming, South Dakota, and other places where native prairie grass could be found. I spent days in the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge (</span>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/neal_smith<span class="CharOverride-3">) in nearby Prairie City, and the Crescent Lake National Wildlife Refuge (</span>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/crescent_lake<span class="CharOverride-3">) far away in the Nebraska sand hills—mile after unbroken mile of grass. I couldn’t get enough of it. I was hooked.</span></p>

I carried my little black loan book to the bank for the last time and saw it marked “Paid in full.” I had been thinking of taking my crop field out of production when the land was paid for and we no longer needed the income to cover the payments. </span></p>

But that was before. What I envisioned that winter as I looked out over the snow-covered bare bean field was prairie.</span></p>

Only this time I would not try to bring a piece of Carolina to Iowa; this time I would try to bring a lost piece of Iowa back home.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I</span><span class="CharOverride-3">n the spring of ‘92 I prepared a seed bed, disked it a second time to kill any emerging weeds, and arranged for the head of the county conservation commission, with help from the local Pheasants Forever (</span>https://pheasantsforever.org<span class="CharOverride-3">) chapter, to drill native grass seed in late May. A few days before this planting I walked the twelve-and-a-half acres with a crank seeder, spreading 30 pounds of forb seed (forbs are non-grassy native plants—mostly flowers). It was an exciting day when the tractor arrived with the drill filled with funny fuzzy little seeds and began crisscrossing the field, marking it like a sheet of graph paper. The seeds were in, and I began to pray for rain—and pray and pray and pray. In the spring of ‘92, as some might recall, no rain came. Of course, the weeds did, which I dutifully clipped, and then finally, about mid-summer with some rain, little blades of grass began to appear. I was beside myself. I went out twice a day with a ruler to measure the progress of these little shoots, and within a fortnight the entire field was as uniformly green as a billiard table. With great excitement, I brought out our local expert to see my miracle prairie. “Foxtail,” he said. “That’s a weed too.” So out again with the tractor: mower and clip, clip, clip, and pray for more rain.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">T</span><span class="CharOverride-3">hat winter I again stared at a bare field, either a uniform brown or a uniform white depending on the snow cover, and when the next spring came it appeared again that the weeds would triumph. I watched in dismay as a slightly fuzzy plant with long finger-</span>like leaves began emerging across the field like the advance guard of an attacking enemy army.<span class="CharOverride-3"> This was beginning to look depressingly familiar. I readied my mower for a counter-attack when suddenly I noticed small buds on each plant. I decided to delay my offensive. Two weeks later I had a twelve-acre carpet of yellow black-eyed Susans. Then, when the truly hot weather of summer came, that year with adequate moisture, the real grasses (the warm-season grasses, as most native varieties are called) made their debut: straight shoots of big bluestem, curly switch grass, feathery Indian grass, and the curiously asymmetrical side oats grama. During the next months, almost everything I had planted appeared: prairie clover, coreopsis, primrose, and, of course, the spectacular purple coneflower. It has been a never-ending show ever since.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">“</span><span class="CharOverride-3">If you build it they will come.” This familiar quote refers to turning a cornfield into a baseball diamond, but it also applies to projects such as mine. If you plant it they will come. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">N</span><span class="CharOverride-3">a</span>tive species that were not in my original seed mix appeared. A few summers later a botanist friend, on a quick walk through the prairie, identified 27 plant <span class="CharOverride-3">varieties I had not planted. The power of the native plants is awesome, and it is with great pleasure that I watched the clumps of bluestem and switch grass begin to crowd out the foxtail and thistle, and choke the ragweed and burdock to death. Ah, sweet revenge.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3"> </span><span class="CharOverride-3">In addition to the flora, there are also enough ring-necked pheasants, turkeys, and magnificent white tailed deer to provide my family and friends with gifts of many splendid meals each year without doing any harm to their healthy populations. Finally, perhaps, I have got it right. My stash is out there; my fix assured.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">I </span><span class="CharOverride-3">have since learned, to my delight, that there are many projects such as mine in Iowa and the Midwest. These projects have three main types: prairie reclamations, prairie replications, and prairie restorations. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">R</span><span class="CharOverride-3">eclamation is discovering and saving a relict prairie, a little piece of ground that has managed to look worthless and hide out for the last couple of hundred years and avoid “progress and improvement.” Old cemeteries often hold some of these treasures. Remarkably there are some interesting relict prairies within in the city limits of Chicago. Replication is what my project is. This involves planting native varieties and enabling a natural process to eventually replicate the original prairie conditions. Restoration is the most complex process—locating and planting native seeds from within a specific area and recreating all the conditions that existed before the original prairie was destroyed. The task is painstaking and daunting, representing much research, work, and most of all, time. I once heard a joke about a Texas billionaire oilman vacationing in London buying up antiques and fine art pieces. On visiting a traditional English garden, he expressed the desire to have one for himself and asked the groundskeeper what it would cost him. “About a hundred years,” was the reply. That is what it costs to restore a prairie—&#9;about a hundred years.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-3">M</span><span class="CharOverride-3">ost Iowa counties are blessed with spots of prairie. From the magnificent Loess Hills to the bluffs along the Mississippi, one can look closely and find relicts, replications, and restorations of all kinds. </span></p>

To my original prairie restoration, I’ve added an additional 80 acres on a farm I was fortunate enough to purchase and “unimprove.”</span></p>

Now less than a tenth of a percent of this vast garden remains. What does remain is a priceless reminder that it was this prairie and hundreds and hundreds of years that provided us with the gift of the richest land in the world. This land and these little overlooked and rebuilt jewels desperately need our notice, our love, and our protection. Addiction&apos;s not all bad.</span></p>
